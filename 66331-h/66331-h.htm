  <h2 class='c004'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>There are probably few people in civilized
life, who—were the question put to
them directly—would not say, that they
consider bread <i>one</i> of the most, if not
the most important article of diet which
enters into the food of man. And yet
there is, in reality, almost a total and
universal carelessness about the character
of bread. Thousands in civic life will,
for years, and perhaps as long as they
live, eat the most miserable trash that can
be imagined, in the form of bread, and
never seem to think that they can possibly
have anything better, nor even that it is
an evil to eat such vile stuff as they do.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>And if there is occasionally an individual
who is troubled with some convictions
that his bread is not quite what it should
be, he knows not how to remedy the difficulty;
for it is a serious truth, that,
although nearly every human being in
civilized life eats bread of some kind or
other, yet scarcely any one has sufficient
knowledge of the true principles and processes
concerned in bread-making, and of
the actual causes of the bad qualities of
bread, to know how, with any degree of
certainty, to avoid bad and secure good
bread.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have thought, therefore, that I could
hardly do society a better service, than to
publish the following treatise on a subject
which, whether people are aware of it or
not, is, in reality, of very great importance
to the health and comfort of every one.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has been prepared for the press with
more haste, under more embarrassments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>from other engagements, and with less
severity of revision, than I could wish. Yet,
whatever may be its defects of arrangement,
method or style, I have taken care
to have the principles correct, and the
instructions such as, if attended to, will
enable every one who is heartily devoted
to the object, to make good bread.</p>

<p class='c008'>I must, however, acknowledge, that I
have very little expectation that proper
attention will be paid to this subject, so
long as the dietetic habits of society continue
to be what they are. While the
various preparations of animal food constitute
so important a portion of human
aliment, the quality of bread will be
greatly disregarded and neglected, and
people will continue almost universally to
be cursed with poor bread.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nevertheless, I trust some good will be
done by the little work I now send out;
and I am not without hope, that it will be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>the means of a considerable improvement
in the quality of bread, and, as a natural
and necessary consequence, an improvement
in the health and happiness of those
who consume it.</p>

<p class='c008'>That it may prove thus beneficial to my
fellow creatures in a high degree, is my
hearty and fervent desire.</p>

  <h2 class='c004' title='HISTORY OF BREAD.'><span class='xlarge'>TREATISE ON BREAD.</span><br /> <br />HISTORY OF BREAD.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Primitive food of man. Bruising and grinding grain.
Baking. Invention of leavened bread. Bread among the
Greeks and Romans—among the Hebrews. Simplicity
of the bread now used in many countries.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the English version of the sacred
scriptures, the term Bread is frequently
used to signify vegetable food in general.
Thus in Gen. iii, 19, the Lord says to
Adam—“In the sweat of thy face shalt
thou eat bread (or food) till thou return to
the ground.” See also Gen. xviii, 5, and
xxviii, 20, and Ex. ii, 20.</p>

<p class='c008'>The most extended sense of the word,
however, according to general usage, comprehends
all farinaceous vegetable substances
which enter into the diet of man;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>such as the farinaceous seeds or grain,
nuts, fruit, roots, &amp;c. And in this extended
sense, Bread, in some form or
other, has been the principal article in the
diet of mankind, from the earliest generations
of the human race, to the present
time; except among the few, small and
scattered tribes, which have, perhaps, ever
since the days of Noah, in different parts
of the earth, subsisted mainly on animal
food.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is nearly certain that the primitive
inhabitants of the earth, ate their food
with very little, if any artificial preparation.</p>

<p class='c008'>The various fruits, nuts, seeds, roots,
and other vegetable substances on which
they fed, were eaten by them in their
natural state, with no other grinding than
that which was done by the teeth.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the human family increased, and
population became more dense and extended,
and providential measures more
necessary, the condition and circumstances
of society gradually led to the invention
and adoption of the simple, and, at first,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>rude arts of domestic life. Among these,
was that of bruising the harder articles
of their food, such as nuts and seeds, or
grain, on flat stones, selected and kept for
the purpose. By constant use, these stones
in time became hollowed out; and being
thereby rendered more convenient, men at
length began to form mortars and pestles
from stones; and probably the next step
was the construction of the rude kind of
hand-mills, which continued in use for
many centuries; and indeed, which, with
the stone mortars, have, throughout all
ages and in almost every portion of the
earth, been used in the ruder states of
society.</p>

<p class='c008'>When men became acquainted with the
use of fire, they probably often parched
their corn or grain before they pounded it;
and afterwards, they learned to mix it
with water into the consistency of dough,
and to bake this, in an unleavened or
unfermented state, on flat stones before
the fire, or in the hot ashes or hot earth,
or in the rude ovens which they formed,
by digging holes in the earth, into which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>they put heated stones, and slightly covered
them with leaves or grass, and then
laid in the article they wished to bake,
and over this strewed some leaves, and
then covered the whole with earth.<a id='rA' /><a href='#fA' class='c011'><sup>[A]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>This kind of unleavened bread, undoubtedly
constituted a very important, if
not the principal article of artificially prepared
food in the diet of the primitive
inhabitants of the earth, for many centuries;
and the same, or very nearly the
same kind of bread continued in general
use down to the days of Abraham; and
it is probable that the unleavened bread
used by his descendants at the feast of the
Passover, before and after they left Egypt,
was of the same kind.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is hardly possible, however, that it
could have been otherwise, than that, at
a much earlier period, larger quantities of
this dough were occasionally made, than
were immediately baked, and consequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>portions of it were suffered to stand and
ferment; and by this means, men were in
process of time learned to make leavened,
or raised bread.</p>

<p class='c008'>At how early a date, loaf or raised
bread came into common use, it is impossible
now to ascertain with any considerable
degree of precision. The scriptures
do not afford us any evidence that Abraham
was accustomed to such bread; but
the fact that Moses, at the institution of
the supper of the Passover, the night
before the Jews left Egypt, commanded
them strictly to abstain from leavened
bread, and to eat only the unleavened,
proves conclusively, that the Israelites at
least, were then accustomed to fermented,
or raised bread.</p>

<p class='c008'>Neither history nor tradition enables us
to speak with any degree of confidence in
regard to the period at which other nations
became acquainted with the art of bread-making;
but from all that has come down
to us from ancient times, we learn that
the primitive generations of every nation,
subsisted on fruits and other products of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>the vegetable kingdom, in their uncooked
or natural state.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The Greeks assert that they were
taught the art of making bread by their
god, Pan; and Pliny informs us that this
art was not known at Rome till near six
hundred years after the foundation of that
city. The Roman armies, he says, on
their return from Macedonia, brought Grecian
bakers into Italy. Before this time,
the Romans prepared their meal in a kind
of pap or soft pudding; and on this account
Pliny calls them pap eaters.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But though the Egyptians and Israelites
were probably among the earliest portions
of the human family, who became acquainted
with the art of making loaf or
raised bread, the quality of their bread
continued to be exceedingly simple and
coarse for many generations.</p>

<p class='c008'>Even after the establishment of the
Hebrew nation in Palestine—in the most
splendid days of Jerusalem—at the period
of the highest refinement of the Jews, in
the arts of civil and domestic life, their
fine flour, from which their choicest bread
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>and cakes were made, was, in comparison
with modern superfine flour, extremely
coarse,—ground mostly by females, in
hand-mills constructed and kept for that
purpose.</p>

<p class='c008'>From Rome the art of bread-making
very slowly found its way over considerable
portions of Europe. A thousand years
after Julius Cæsar first entered Britain, the
rude people of that country were little
acquainted with raised bread. “Even at
present,” says Prof. Thomson, “loaf bread
is seldom used except by the higher classes
of inhabitants, in the northern countries of
Europe and Asia.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In Eastern and Southern Asia, rice constitutes
the principal bread-stuff; and this
is generally prepared with great simplicity.
In Middle and Western Asia, and in Africa,
bread, though made of different kinds of
grain, is prepared with almost equal simplicity.
In Scotland, Ireland, and indeed
throughout Europe generally, barley, oats,
rye, potatoes, peas, beans, chesnuts, and
other farinaceous vegetables, constitute the
bread-stuff of most of the laboring people,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>or peasantry. In the islands of the Pacific
and Southern oceans, the bread of the inhabitants
consists of the plantain, bananas,
yams, bread-fruit, and other like vegetables,
simply roasted, baked, or boiled.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bread, therefore, of some kind or other,
made of some of the farinaceous products
of the vegetable kingdom, has probably,
in almost every portion of the world, and
every period of time, been one of the first,
and most important, and universal articles
of food, artificially prepared by cooking,
which has entered into the diet of
mankind; and hence it has with great
propriety been called “the staff of life.”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>LAWS OF DIET.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Reasons why food in its natural state would be the best.
Concentrated nutriment. Interesting experiments on animals.
Mixtures of food. Leavened and unleavened bread.
Qualifications of the best bread.</p>

<p class='c007'>If man were to subsist wholly on alimentary
substances in their natural state,
or without any artificial preparation by
cooking, then he would be obliged to use
his teeth freely in masticating his food;
and by so doing, not only preserve his
teeth from decay, and keep them in sound
health, but at the same time, and by the
same means, would he thoroughly mix
his food with the fluid of his mouth, and
thus prepare it both for swallowing and
for the action of the stomach, and by the
same means also, he would be made to
swallow his food slowly, as the welfare
of the stomach and of the whole system
requires he should.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>Again, if man were to subsist wholly
on uncooked food, he would never suffer
from the improper temperature of his aliment.
Hot substances taken into the
mouth, serve more directly and powerfully
to destroy the teeth, than any other cause
which acts immediately upon them; and
hot food and drink received into the stomach,
always in some degree debilitate
that organ, and through it, every other
organ and portion of the whole system;
diminishing, as an ultimate result, the
vital power of every part—impairing every
function, and increasing the susceptibility
of the whole body to the action of disturbing
causes, and predisposing it to
disease. Again, if man were to subsist
entirely on food in a natural state, he
would never suffer from concentrated aliment.
Every substance in nature which
God has prepared for the food of man,
consists of both nutritious and innutritious
matter. The proportions vary in different
kinds of food. Thus in a hundred pounds
of potatoes, there are about twenty-five
pounds of nourishing matter; while in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>hundred pounds of good wheat there are
about eighty pounds of nourishing matter.
There are a few products of the vegetable
kingdom which are still higher in the
scale of nutriment, than wheat; and on
the other hand there is a boundless variety
ranging below wheat, extending down to
three or four per cent. of nourishment.
But nature, without the aid of human art,
produces nothing for the alimentary use of
man which is purely a concentrated nutrient
substance. And God has constructed
man in strict accordance with this general
economy of nature. He has organized
and endowed the human body with reference
to the condition and qualities of those
substances in nature, which He designed
for the food of man. And consequently,
while man obeys the laws of constitution
and relation which should govern him in
regard to his food, he preserves the health
and integrity of his alimentary organs,
and through them of his whole nature;
and so far as his dietetic habits are concerned,
secures the highest and best condition
of his nature. But, if he disregards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>these laws, and by artificial means greatly
departs from the natural adaptation of
things, he inevitably brings evil on himself
and on his posterity.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has been fully proved that “bulk, or
a due proportion of innutritious matter in
our food, is quite as important to health as
nourishment.” Human beings may subsist
from childhood to extreme old age on
good potatoes and pure water alone, and
enjoy the best and most uninterrupted
health, and possess the greatest muscular
power and ability to endure protracted
fatigue and exposure. But if the purely
nutrient matter of the potato be separated
out by artificial means, and human beings,
fed exclusively on this concentrated form
of aliment and pure water, they will soon
perish, because the alimentary organs of
man are not constituted and endowed for
such kinds of food. And this is true of
all animals, in the higher orders, at least.</p>

<p class='c008'>We know that dogs fed on sugar and
water, gum and water, fine flour bread
and water, or any other kind of concentrated
aliment, will soon languish, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>droop, and emaciate, and die; but if a
due proportion of proper innutritious substance
be mixed with these concentrated
forms of aliment, the dogs will subsist on
them and remain healthy. So if horses,
cows, deer, sheep, and other grass-eating
animals be fed on grain alone, they will
soon lose their appetite and begin to droop,
and will shortly perish; but if a due proportion
of straw or shavings of wood be
given them with their grain, they will continue
to do well. Man is affected in the
same manner. He cannot long subsist on
purely nutritious substances. And the
reason is not because these substances
have no azote or nitrogen in them; nor
is it because man <i>necessarily</i> requires a
variety of alimentary substances, but simply
and exclusively because the anatomical
construction and vital powers of the
alimentary organs, are constitutionally
adapted to alimentary substances which
consist of both nutritious and innutritious
matter; and therefore a due proportion of
innutritious matter in the food of man is
as essential to the welfare of his alimentary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>organs, as a due proportion of nourishment
is to the support of his body.</p>

<p class='c008'>Again, if man subsisted wholly on uncooked
food, he would not only be preserved
from improper concentrations, but
also from pernicious combinations of alimentary
substances. The alimentary organs
of man, like those of the horse, ox,
sheep, dog, cat, and most or all other
animals of the higher orders, if not in fact,
of all other animals without limitation,
possess the vital capability of so accommodating
themselves to emergencies, that
they can be made to digest almost every
vegetable and animal substance in nature;
and they can, by long training, be educated
to digest a mixture of these substances at
the same time. Nevertheless it is incontestibly
true, that the alimentary organs
of man and of all other animals, can manage
one kind of food at a time better than
a mixed ingestion; for it is impossible
that the solvent fluids secreted by the
stomach and other organs belonging to the
alimentary apparatus, should be at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>same time equally well adapted to entirely
different kinds of food.</p>

<p class='c008'>I do not say that the alimentary organs
of man cannot, by long habit, be brought
into such a condition as that, while that
condition remains, they will not manage a
mixed ingestion of animal and vegetable
food, with more immediate comfort and
satisfaction to themselves and the individual,
than they will an ingestion of
pure vegetable food. But this does not
militate against the general principle in
the least; for it is nevertheless true, that
the same organs are capable of being
brought into a condition in which they
will manage an ingestion of unmixed food
of either kind, with less embarrassment
and injury to themselves and the whole
system, than they can the mixed food in
any condition. Hence it is a general law
of nature, concerning the dietetic habits of
man, that simplicity of food at each meal
is essential to the highest well-being of the
individual and of the race.</p>

<p class='c008'>God has unquestionably provided a
great and rich variety of substances for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>man’s nourishment and enjoyment; but it
is equally certain that he did not design
that man should partake of all this variety
at a single meal, nor in a single day, nor
season—but from meal to meal, from day
to day, and from season to season, varying
his enjoyment in strictest consistency with
the great laws of his nature. And hence
all artificial combinations of alimentary
substances, and particularly those of a
heterogeneous kind, and yet more especially
the concentrated forms, must be more or
less pernicious to the alimentary organs,
and through them to the whole system.</p>

<p class='c008'>Finally, if man subsisted wholly on
uncooked food, the undepraved integrity
of his appetite, his thorough mastication
and slow swallowing, and his simple meal,
would greatly serve to prevent his overeating,
and thus save him from the ruinous
effects of one of the most destructive
causes operating in civic life.</p>

<p class='c008'>Whatever may be the material, therefore,
from which bread is made, when the
artificial preparation is of that simple
character which leaves the proportions of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>nutritious and innutritious properties, as
nature combined them, and effects little
change in the nutritious principles, and
retains the natural requisition for the function
of the teeth, and thus secures the
proper chewing of the food and the mixing
of it with the fluids of the mouth, and
swallowing of it slowly, the artificial process
militates very little, if at all, against
any of the physiological or vital interests
of the body. But if our artificial process
of bread-making, concentrates the nutrient
properties, and destroys the due proportion
between the bulk and nourishment, and
forms improper changes and combinations
in the nutrient elements, and does away
the necessity for mastication or chewing,
and presents the food in too elevated a
temperature, or too hot, and enables us to
swallow it too rapidly, with little or no
exercise of the teeth, and without properly
mixing it with the fluids of the mouth,
the artificial process or cooking is decidedly
and often exceedingly inimical, not
only to the vital interests of the alimentary
organs, but of the whole human system.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>In all civilized nations, and particularly
in civic life, bread, as I have already
stated, is far the most important article of
food which is artificially prepared; and in
our country and climate, it is the most
important article that enters into the diet
of man; and therefore it is of the first
consideration, that its character should, in
every respect, be as nearly as possible,
consistent with the laws of constitution
and relation established in our nature; or
with the anatomical construction and vital
properties and powers and interest of our
systems.</p>

<p class='c008'>If we contemplate the human constitution
in its highest and best condition,—in
the possession of its most vigorous and
unimpaired powers—and ask, what must
be the character of our bread in order to
preserve that constitution in that condition?
the answer most indubitably is, that
the coarse unleavened bread of early times,
when of proper age, was one of the least
removes from the natural state of food,—one
of the simplest and most wholesome
forms of artificial preparations, and best
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>adapted to fulfil the laws of constitution
and relation; and therefore best adapted
to sustain the most vigorous and healthy
state of the alimentary organs, and the
highest and best condition of the whole
nature of man, as a general and permanent
fact; and hence it is very questionable
whether loaf or raised bread can be
made equally conducive to all the interests
of our nature, with the simple unleavened
bread.</p>

<p class='c008'>I am aware that many professional men
entertain a very different opinion on this
subject, and speak of unleavened bread
as being less nourishing and less easily
digested. This may be true to a limited
extent, in special cases of impaired and
debilitated alimentary organs; but I am
confident that as a general fact the notion
is entirely erroneous.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The whole people of Asia,” says Dr.
Cullen, “live upon unfermented rice. The
Americans, before they became acquainted
with the Europeans, employed, and for
the most part, still employ their maize in
the same condition. Even in Europe, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>employment of unfermented bread, and unfermented
farinaceæ in other forms, is still
very considerable, and we are ready to
maintain that the morbid consequences of
such a diet are very seldom to be observed.
In Scotland, nine tenths of the
lower classes of people—and that is the
greater part of the whole—live upon unfermented
bread and unfermented farinaceæ
in other forms, and at the same time, I
am of opinion that there are not a more
healthy people anywhere to be found.
We give it to all classes and both sexes
with advantage.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It is incontestibly true, that if two portions
of the same kind of wheat meal be
taken and made, the one into unleavened
and the other into leavened bread, and
both be eaten warm from the oven, the
leavened bread will prove much more
oppressive and difficult to manage in the
stomach than the unleavened. But aside
from the changes that are produced by the
process of fermentation, there are many
other considerations why unleavened bread
of a proper quality and age, is better
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>adapted to sustain the alimentary organs
and general constitution of man, in their
highest and best condition.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nevertheless, it is very certain, that loaf
or raised bread can be made so nearly in
accordance with the vital laws and interests
of our bodies, as scarcely to militate
against them in any perceptible or appreciable
degree. And when I say this, I
mean not merely its effects on the health
and longevity of a single individual, but
its effects upon the human constitution,
through successive generations, for a thousand
years or more.</p>

<p class='c008'>As a general criterion or rule, then, in
regard to the character of bread, we perceive
that the most perfect loaf or raised
bread, is that which, being made of the
best material, is light, and sweet, and well
baked, and still most nearly retains all the
natural proportions and properties of the
original material.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>MATERIAL OF BREAD.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Wheat. Extent of climate favorable to it. Injured by improper
tillage. Removal of impurities. Washing of grain.
Separation of the bran from the nutrient particles improper.
Ancient Roman bread. Public bakers. Use of bad flour.
Adulterations. Poisonous agents used to disguise them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the materials used for making
bread in our country—and, in fact, of all
the known productions of the vegetable
kingdom in any country, wheat is decidedly
the best; and it is a remarkable fact,
that wheat comes nearer to man than perhaps
any other plant, in its power of
becoming adapted to different climates,
over a wide extent of the earth’s surface,
so that it may almost be said that wherever
the human species can flourish, there
wheat can be cultivated.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is not certainly known,” says Prof.
Thomson, “in what country wheat was
first produced. Mr. Bruce informs us that
he found it growing wild in Abyssinia;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>and in his opinion, that kingdom is the
native country of the plant. It would
seem,” continues the Professor, “to be
originally an African plant, since it thrives
best in Barbary and Egypt; and perhaps
the mountains of Abyssinia, though within
the torrid zone, may not differ much in
point of climate, from the more northern
plains of Egypt. Wheat is perhaps cultivated
over a greater extent of the globe
than any other plant. Excellent crops are
raised as far north as Sweden, in latitude
60°; it is cultivated in the East Indies,
considerably within the limits of the torrid
zone; and in the North of Hindostan, it
constitutes a chief article in the food of
the inhabitants. In India, however, the
plant seems to have deteriorated. It is
always dwarfish, and the crop is said to
be less abundant than in more northern
climates.” Yet a cold climate is not most
genial to the nature of this plant. “The
wheat of France is superior to that of
England; the wheat of Italy is still better
than that of France; and perhaps the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>best of all is raised in Barbary and
Egypt.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Excellent wheat is raised in the southern,
and western, and middle portions of
the United States; and even in the northern
and eastern parts of New England,
very fine crops have been produced.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the wheat and other cultivated products
of the vegetable kingdom appropriated
to the nourishment of man, like
those on which our domestic animals
subsist, are too generally, in civilized life,
very considerably deteriorated, as to their
wholesomeness, by the improper tillage of
the soil. I have no doubt that it is true,
as stated by those who have made the
experiment, that the flour of wheat, raised
on a cultivated soil recently dressed with
crude, stable manure, may readily be distinguished
by its odor, from the flour of
wheat raised on a new and undepraved
soil, or from that raised on a cultivated
soil which has been dressed with properly
digested manure. And if such and similar
results of improper tillage can become
the sources of serious evil to the human
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>family, through their effects on the flesh
of animals which man devours, and on
the milk and butter which he consumes,
surely the immediate effects of such a
deteriorated vegetable aliment on the human
system, must be very considerable.</p>

<p class='c008'>They who have never eaten bread made
of wheat, recently produced by a pure virgin
soil, have but a very imperfect notion
of the deliciousness of good bread; such
as is often to be met with in the comfortable
log houses in our western country. It
is probably true that the new soil, in its
virgin purity, before it becomes exhausted
by tillage, and debauched by the means
which man uses to enrich and stimulate
it, produces most, if not all kinds of vegetables
appropriate for human aliment, in
a more perfect and healthy state, than
any soil which has been long under cultivation,
can be made to do. Nevertheless,
by a proper application of physiological
principles to agriculture, many
of the evils which now result from improper
tillage may easily be avoided, and the
quality of all those vegetable substances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>which enter into the diet of man may be
very greatly improved, both in regard to
wholesomeness and deliciousness.</p>

<p class='c008'>But while the people of our country are
so entirely given up as they are at present,
to gross and promiscuous feeding on the
dead carcasses of animals, and to the
untiring pursuits of wealth, it is perhaps
wholly in vain for a single individual to
raise his voice on a subject of this kind.
The farmer will continue to be most eager
to increase the number of his acres, and
to extort from those acres the greatest
amount of produce, with the least expense
of tillage, and with little or no regard to
the quality of that produce in relation to
the physiological interests of man; while
the people generally, are contented to
gratify their depraved appetites on whatever
comes before them, without pausing
to inquire whether their indulgences are
adapted to preserve or to destroy their
health and life. Yet if some one does not
raise a voice upon this subject which shall
be heard and heeded, there will soon reach
us, as a nation, a voice of calamity which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>we shall not be able to shut our ears
against, albeit we may in the perverseness
of our sensualism, incorrigibly persist in
disregarding its admonitions, till the deep
chastisements of outraged nature shall
reach the very “bone and marrow” of
the human constitution, and fill our land
with such a living rottenness, as now in
some other portions of the earth, renders
human society odious and abominable.</p>

<p class='c008'>Whether, therefore, my voice shall be
heard and heeded or not, I will obey the
dictates of my sense of duty, and solemnly
declare that this subject demands the
prompt and earnest attention of every
agriculturist and of every friend to the
common cause of humanity; for it is most
certain, that until the agriculture of our
country is conducted in strict accordance
with physiological truth, it is not possible
for us to realize those physical, and intellectual,
and moral, and social, and civil
blessings for which the human constitution
and our soil and climate are naturally
capacitated.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>When proper attention has been paid
to the character of the wheat itself, the
next thing is to see that it is thoroughly
cleansed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sometimes, in consequence of the peculiarities
of the season, or climate, or soil,
or some other cause, there will be a species
of disease affecting the wheat and other
grains; and this may be of such a character
as not easily to be removed nor counteracted
by any means; but more generally
the rust, and smut, and dust, which
attach themselves to the skin of the grain,
may, by proper care, be so far removed, as
at least to render the meal or flour far
more pure and wholesome than it otherwise
would be. And here let me remark,
that they are greatly deceived, who suppose
that the bolting cloth which separates
the fine flour from the outer skin or bran,
also separates the impurities attached to
the outer skin from the flour. By the
process of grinding, these impurities are
rubbed from the outer skin, and made
quite as fine as any portion of the flour,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>and for the most part pass with the fine
flour through the bolting cloth.</p>

<p class='c008'>To remedy this, it is perhaps generally
true, that in large flouring establishments,
a kind of smut or scouring mill is in operation,
through which the wheat passes, and
is pretty thoroughly rubbed or scoured
without being broken; and after this, it
passes through a screen or winnowing
mill, and thus is tolerably well cleansed
and prepared for grinding. Yet this process
by no means renders the wheat so
perfectly clean and wholesome as washing.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those who have given little attention to
this subject, will probably think that the
trouble of washing all their bread-stuff
before it is ground, would be much greater
than any benefit which would result from
it. But a short experience in the matter,
would convince every one who has a proper
regard for the character of his bread,
that the trouble of washing his grain bears
no comparison to the improvement effected
by it. Indeed, they who become accustomed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>to washing their grain, will soon
cease to regard it as a trouble; and the
improvement in the whiteness and sweetness
of their bread will be so great, that
they would be extremely unwilling to
relinquish the practice.</p>

<p class='c008'>When people are so situated that they
can have things as they wish, they will
also find that their bread is much richer,
if the grain is ground but a short time
before it is cooked.</p>

<p class='c008'>The best way, therefore, is, for every
family to raise or purchase a sufficient
quantity of the best new wheat that can
be produced by proper tillage in a good
soil, and put that away in clean casks or
bins, where it will be kept perfectly dry
and sweet; and, according to the size of
the family, take, from time to time, as they
need it, one or two bushels, and wash it
thoroughly but briskly in two or three
waters, and then spread it out on a drying
sheet or table, made for the purpose, and
which is considerably inclined, so that
the water remaining with the wheat will
easily run off.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>The skin or bran of the wheat is so
well protected by its own oily property,
that little or no water will penetrate it,
unless it be suffered to remain in the water
much longer than is necessary. Being
thinly spread out upon the sheet or table
in a good drying day, it will be sufficiently
dry in a few hours for grinding.
And I say again, let any one who loves
good bread, wash his grain a few times in
this manner, and he will be very reluctant
to return to the use of bread made of
unwashed grain.</p>

<p class='c008'>It would be difficult to ascertain at how
early a period in the progress of society,
mankind, in the preparation of wheat for
bread-making, began to put asunder what
God has joined together, and to concentrate
the more purely nutrient properties,
by separating the flour from the part commonly
called the bran. The Bible speaks
of fine flour or meal, as a portion of the
meat offerings of the temple, but it is not
probable this approached very near to the
superfine flour of the present time.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>We are informed also that the Romans,
more than two thousand years ago, had
four or five different kinds of bread—one
of which was made of the purest flour,
from which all the bran was separated.
This was eaten only by the rich and luxurious.
A second kind, in more common
use, was that from which a portion of the
bran was taken; and a third kind, which
was more generally used than any other,
was that which was made of the whole
substance of the wheat. A fourth kind
was made mostly of the bran, for dogs.</p>

<p class='c008'>But at whatever period in the history of
the race, this artificial process was commenced,
certain it is that in direct violation
of the laws of constitution and relation
which the Creator has established in
the nature of man, this process of mechanical
analysis is, at the present day,
carried to the full extent of possibility;
and the farina, and gluten, and saccharine
matter of the wheat, are almost perfectly
concentrated in the form of superfine flour.
Nor is this all—these concentrated nutrient
properties of the wheat are mixed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>and complicated in ways innumerable,
with other concentrated substances, to
pamper the depraved appetites of man,
with kinds of food which always and
inevitably tend to impair his health and to
abbreviate his life.</p>

<p class='c008'>Even the bread, which is the simplest
form into which human ingenuity tortures
the flour of wheat, is, by other causes
besides the concentration I have named,
too frequently rendered the instrument of
disease and death, rather than the means
of life and health, to those that eat it.</p>

<p class='c008'>In cities and large towns, most people
depend on public bakers for their bread.
And I have no doubt that public bakers,
as a body, are as honest and worthy a
class of men as any in society. I have
no wish to speak evil of any one; and it
is always painful to me to find myself
compelled, in fidelity to the common
cause of humanity, to expose the faults
of any particular class of men, when probably
every other class in society is as
deeply involved in errors which, in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>sight of God, evince, at least, an equal
degree of moral turpitude.</p>

<p class='c008'>But public bakers, like other men, who
serve the public more for the sake of securing
their own emolument than for the
public good, have always had recourse to
various expedients in order to increase the
lucrativeness of their business.</p>

<p class='c008'>To secure custom and profit at the same
time, they have considered it necessary,
that a given quantity of flour should be
made into a loaf as large and as white as
possible, and free from any disagreeable
taste, while at the same time it retains the
greatest possible weight.</p>

<p class='c008'>From a variety of causes, the quality
and price of flour have always been very
unstable. Sometimes the crops are small,
or the foreign demand for flour or the
home consumption is unusually great, or
the season is unfavorable to the health of
grain, and the wheat becomes diseased, or
the harvest time is unfavorable, and the
wheat sprouts before it is secured, or large
quantities of flour become soured or musty,
or in some other manner damaged.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>To counteract these things, and to make
the most profitable use of such flour as
the market affords them, the public bakers
have been led to try various experiments
with chemical agents, and there is reason
to believe that in numerous instances, they
have been too successful in their practices,
for the well-being of those who have been
the consumers of their bread.</p>

<p class='c008'>According to treatises on bread-making,
which have within a few years past appeared
in European scientific journals,
“alum, sulphate of zinc, sub-carbonate of
magnesia, sub-carbonate of ammonia, sulphate
of copper, and several other substances,
have been used by public bakers
in making bread; and some of these substances
have been employed by them to a
very great extent, and with very great
success in the cause of their cupidity.
They have not only succeeded by such
means, in making light and white bread
out of extremely poor flour, but they have
also been able so to disguise their adulterations,
as to work in with their flour, without
being detected by the consumers, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>portion of the flour of beans, peas and
potatoes—and even chalk, pipe clay and
plaster of Paris, have been employed to
increase the weight and whiteness of their
bread.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The use of alum in bread-making,”
says a distinguished chemist, “appears to
be very ancient. It is one of those articles
which have been the most extensively
and successfully used in disguising
bad flour, and the various adulterations of
bread. Its injurious action upon the health
is not to be compared with that of sulphate
of copper, and yet, daily taken into
the stomach, it may seriously affect the
system.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thirteen bakers were condemned on
the 27th of January, 1829, by the correctional
tribunal of Brussels, for mixing
sulphate of copper or blue vitriol with
their bread. It makes the bread very
white, light, large and porous, but rather
tasteless; and it also enables the bread to
retain a greater quantity of water, and
thereby very considerably increases its
weight. A much larger quantity of alum
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>is necessary to produce these effects; but
when of sufficient quantity, it strengthens
the paste, and, as the bakers say, ‘makes
the bread swell large.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>If the statements of our large druggists
can be relied on, the public bakers of our
own country probably employ ammonia
more freely, at present, than any other
substance I have named. Pearlash or
saleratus is also used by them in considerable
quantities.</p>

<p class='c008'>But even where these adulterations are
not practised, the bakers’ bread is very
rarely a wholesome article of diet.</p>

<p class='c008'>If any dependence is to be placed on
the testimony of several of the principal
bakers and flour merchants in New York,
Boston and other cities, the flour which
most of our public bakers work into bread,
is of a very inferior quality to what is
called good “family flour,” and for which
they pay from one to three dollars less per
barrel; and they sometimes purchase large
quantities of old spoiled flour from New
Orleans and elsewhere, which has heated
and soured in the barrel, and perhaps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>become almost as solid as a mass of chalk;
so that they are obliged to break it up,
and grind it over, and spread it out, and
expose it to the air, in order to purify it in
a measure from its acid and other bad
properties; and then they mix it with a
portion of much better flour; and from
this mixture they can make, as they say,
the very largest and finest looking loaf.<a id='rB' /><a href='#fB' class='c011'><sup>[B]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>But should the public bakers always
use the best of flour, their bread, as a general
statement, would still be very inferior
to well made domestic bread, in point
of sweetness and wholesomeness. Their
mode of manufacturing bread—to say the
least of it—destroys much of the virtue of
the flour or meal; and hence their bread
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>is only palatable—even to those who are
accustomed to it—within twelve, or at
the longest, twenty-four hours after it is
baked.</p>

<p class='c008'>But I must repeat, that in making these
statements, I am not prompted by any
unkind feelings towards public bakers; I
have no doubt that they are as honest in
their calling as any other class of men;
but perhaps there is no other class pursuing
an interest founded on the necessities
of their fellow creatures, whose expedients
to increase the lucrativeness of their business,
are so immediately and universally
injurious to the health of those on whom
they depend for support.</p>

<p class='c008'>If any of my statements are thought to
be exaggerated or incorrect, I can only
say, that with honest and benevolent intentions,
I have diligently sought for the
truth; and if I have been in any respect
betrayed into error, I have been misinformed
by public bakers themselves, who
certainly ought to know the truth in this
matter; and who could have no conceivable
reason for making the general character
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>of their calling appear worse than it
really is. Nevertheless, I have no question
that there are individuals in every
city employed as public bakers, who are
too honest—too conscientious—too upright
in heart, to be guilty of any practice which
they consider fraudulent or improper.</p>

<p class='c008'>Still, truth compels me to declare, that
if we would have good and wholesome
bread, it must be made within the precincts
of our own domestic threshold; and
by those whose skill and care are exercised
more with a view to secure our
health and happiness, than their own
pecuniary interest.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>PROPERTIES OF BREAD.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Superfine flour injurious—a probable cause of some common
disorders. Objections to coarse bread. Its medical
properties. Extensive experiments of its use, by soldiers
and others. Use among European peasantry. Selection,
preservation and grinding of wheat.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whether our bread is of domestic manufacture
or made by the public baker,
that which is made of superfine flour is
always far less wholesome, in any and
every situation of life, than that which is
made of wheaten meal which contains all
the natural properties of the grain.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is true, that when much flesh is eaten
with our bread, or when bread constitutes
but a very small and unimportant portion
of our food, the injurious effects of superfine
flour bread are not always so immediately
and distinctly perceived as in other
cases. Nevertheless, it is a general and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>invariable law of our nature, that all concentrated
forms of food are unfriendly to
the physiological or vital interests of our
bodies.</p>

<p class='c008'>A very large proportion of all the diseases
and ailments in civic life, are originated
by causes which are introduced into
the alimentary canal as articles of diet;
and disturbance and derangement of function—obstructions,
debility and irritations,
are among the most important elements of
those diseases.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is, probably, speaking within bounds,
to say that nine tenths of the adults, and
nearly as large a proportion of youth in
civic life, are more or less afflicted with
obstructions and disturbances in the stomach
and bowels, and other organs of the
abdomen, the symptoms of which are
either habitual costiveness or diarrhœa, or
an alternation of both; or frequent and
severe attacks of what are called bilious
colics, &amp;c., &amp;c.; and in children and youth,
worms, fits, convulsions, &amp;c. And I cannot
but feel confident, that the use of
superfine flour bread is among the important
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>causes of these and numerous other
difficulties.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have indeed been surprised to observe,
that in the hundreds of cases of chronic
diseases of every form and name, which
have come to my knowledge within the
last five or six years, costiveness of the
bowels has in almost every instance been
among the first and most important symptoms.
And I have never known this difficulty,
even after an obstinate continuance
of five, ten, twenty or thirty years, fail to
disappear in a short time, after the coarse
wheaten bread of a proper character has
been substituted for that made of superfine
flour.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some physicians and other individuals,
without properly examining the subject,
have raised several objections against the
coarse wheaten bread.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is said, in the first place, that bran is
wholly indigestible, and therefore should
never be taken into the human stomach.</p>

<p class='c008'>This objection betrays so much ignorance
of the final causes and constitutional
laws, clearly indicated by the anatomical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>structure and physiological economy of
the alimentary organs, that it scarcely
deserves the slightest notice. If the digestive
organs of man were designed to
receive nothing but digestible and nutrient
substances, they would have been constructed
and arranged very differently
from what they are. As we have already
seen, everything which nature provides
for our sustenance, consists of certain proportions
of nutritious and innutritious matter;
and a due proportion of innutritious
matter in our food is as essential to the
health and functional integrity of our
alimentary organs, as a due proportion of
nutritious matter is to the sustenance of
the body.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another objection is, that although bran
may serve, like other mechanical irritants
and excitants, for a while, to relieve constipation,
yet it soon wears out the excitability
of the organs, and leaves them more
inactive than before.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here again, a false statement is urged
by inexcusable ignorance; for it is not
true that the bran acts in the manner supposed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>in this objection; nor are the effects
here asserted ever produced by it.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is true, however, that the very pernicious
habits of some people, who use the
coarse wheaten bread, entirely counteract
the aperient effects of the bread; and it is
true that others, depending wholly on the
virtues of this bread for peristaltic action,
and neglecting all exercise, by their extreme
inertness, and indolence, and overeating,
bring on a sluggishness, and debility,
and constipation of the bowels, and
perhaps become severely afflicted with
piles, in spite of the natural fitness of the
bread to promote regular peristaltic action,
and to prevent all these results.</p>

<p class='c008'>A third objection is, that though the
coarse wheaten bread may do very well
for those who are troubled with constipation,
by mechanically irritating and exciting
the stomach and bowels, yet for that
very reason it is wholly unfit and improper
for those who are afflicted with chronic
diarrhœa.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here is still another objection founded
in ignorance of the true physiological and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>pathological principles which it involves.
The truth is, that the coarse wheaten
bread, under a proper general regimen, is
as excellent and sure a remedy for chronic
diarrhœa as for chronic constipation.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have seen cases of chronic diarrhœa
of the most obstinate character, and which
had baffled the highest medical skill and
every mode of treatment for more than
twenty years, yielding entirely under a
proper general regimen, in which this
bread was the almost exclusive article of
food, and not a particle of medicine was
used. And I have never known such a
mode of treatment to fail of wholly relieving
diarrhœa, whether recent or chronic;
although a very great number of cases
have come under my notice.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is fully evident, therefore, that the
bran does not act on the digestive organs
as a mere mechanical irritant; for if it did,
it would always necessarily aggravate,
rather than alleviate diarrhœa. Nor does
it relieve diarrhœa on the principle of a
narcotic nor of a stimulant; for the effect
of these is always to give an immediate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>check to that complaint; and in such a
manner as to expose the system to a return
of it. But the coarse wheaten bread <i>seems</i>
to increase the disease for a short time,
at first, and then gradually restores the
healthy condition and action of the bowels.</p>

<p class='c008'>The mucilage of wheat bran is probably
one of the most soothing substances in the
vegetable kingdom, that can be applied to
the mucous membrane of the stomach and
bowels.</p>

<p class='c008'>Chronic constipation and chronic diarrhœa,
both spring from the same root.
Where the constitutional vigor of the alimentary
canal is very considerable, continued
irritations, resulting in debility, will
produce constipation; and these continued
causes operating for some time, will often
induce such a state of debility and irritability
as is attended with diarrhœa:—and
in other cases, when this constitutional
vigor of the alimentary canal is much less,
diarrhœa is far more readily induced, and
rendered chronic.</p>

<p class='c008'>Coarse wheaten bread, then, by its adaptation
to the anatomical structure and to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>the physiological properties and functional
powers of our organs, serves to prevent and
to remove the disorders and diseases of our
bodies, only by preventing and removing
irritation and morbid action and condition,
and thereby affording the system an opportunity
of recovering its healthy and vigorous
action and condition. And the thousands
of individuals in our own country of
every age—of both sexes—of all situations,
conditions and circumstances, who within
the last six years have been benefited by
using the coarse wheaten bread, instead of
that made of superfine flour, are living
witnesses of the virtues of that bread.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the testimony in favor of coarse
wheaten bread as an important article in
the food of man, is by no means limited
to our own country nor to modern times.</p>

<p class='c008'>In all probability, as we have already
seen, the first generations of our species,
who became acquainted with the art of
making bread, continued for many centuries
to employ all the substance of the
grain, which they coarsely mashed in their
rude mortars or mills. And even since
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>mankind began, by artificial means, to
separate the bran from the flour, and to
make bread from the latter, the more close
and discerning observers among physicians
and philanthropists, have perceived and
asserted, that bread made of fine flour is
decidedly less wholesome than that made
of the unbolted wheat meal.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hippocrates, styled the father of medicine,
who flourished more than two thousand
years ago, and who depended far
more on a correct diet and general regimen,
both for the prevention and removal of disease,
than he did on medicine, particularly
commended the unbolted wheat meal bread,
“for its salutary effects upon the bowels.”
It was a fact well understood by the ancients,
that this bread was much more conducive
to the general health and vigor of
their bodies, and every way better adapted
to nourish and sustain them than that made
of the fine flour. And accordingly, their
wrestlers and others who were trained for
great bodily power, “ate only the coarse
wheaten bread, to preserve them in their
strength of limbs.” The Spartans were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>famous for this kind of bread; and we
learn from Pliny that the Romans, as a
nation, at that period of their history when
they were the most remarkable for bodily
vigor and personal prowess and achievement,
knew no other bread for three hundred
years. The warlike and powerful
nations which overran the Roman Empire,
and finally spread over the greater part of
Europe, used no other kind of bread than
that which was made of the whole substance
of the grain; and from the fall of the
Roman Empire to the present day, a large
proportion of the inhabitants of all Europe
and the greater part of Asia, have rarely
used any other kind of bread.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you set any value on health, and
have a mind to preserve nature,”—said
Thomas Tryon, student in physic, in his
“Way to Health, Long Life and Happiness,”
published in London, in the latter
part of the fifteenth century,—“you
must not separate the finest from the
coarsest flour; because that which is fine
is naturally of an obstructive and stopping
quality; but, on the contrary, the other,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>which is coarse, is of a cleansing and
opening nature, therefore the bread is best
which is made of both together. It is
more wholesome, easier of digestion, and
more strengthening than bread made of the
finest flour. It must be confessed, that
the nutrimentive quality is contained in
the fine flour; yet, in the branny part is
contained the opening and digestive quality;
and there is as great a necessity for
the one as the other, for the support of
health: that which is accounted the worst
is as good and beneficial to nature as the
best; for when the finest flour is separated
from the coarsest and branny parts, neither
the one nor the other has the true operations
of the wheat meal. The eating of
fine bread, therefore, is inimical to health,
and contrary both to nature and reason;
and was at first invented to gratify <i>wanton</i>
and <i>luxurious</i> persons, who are ignorant
both of themselves, and the true
virtue and efficacy of natural things.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Baron Steuben has often told me,”
says Judge Peters, “that the peculiar
healthfulness of the Prussian soldiers, was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>in a great measure to be attributed to their
ammunition bread, made of grain, triturated
or ground, but not bolted; which
was accounted the most wholesome and
nutritious part of their rations.”<a id='rC' /><a href='#fC' class='c011'><sup>[C]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>“The Dutch sailors, in the days of their
naval glory, were supplied with the same
kind of bread.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“During the war between England and
France, near the close of the last century,”
says Mr. Samuel Prior, a respectable merchant
of Salem, New Jersey—“the crops
of grain, and particularly wheat, were
very small in England, and the supplies
from Dantzic, the Netherlands and Sweden
being cut off by the French army,
and also the usual supplies from America
failing, there was a very great scarcity of
wheat in England. The British army
was then very extensive, and it was exceedingly
difficult to procure provisions
for it, both at home and abroad—on land
and sea. Such was the demand for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>foreign army, and such the deficiency of
crops at home and supplies from abroad,
that serious fears were entertained that the
army would suffer, and that the continental
enterprise of the British government
would be defeated in consequence of the
scarcity of provisions; and every prudential
measure by which such a disastrous
event could be prevented, was carefully
considered and proposed. William Pitt
was then prime minister of state, and at
his instance, government recommended to
the people generally throughout Great
Britain, to substitute potatoes and rice as
far as possible, for bread, in order to save
the wheat for the foreign army. This
recommendation was promptly complied
with by many of the people. But still
the scarcity was alarmingly great. In this
emergency, parliament passed a law (to
take effect for two years) that the army at
home should be supplied with bread made
of unbolted wheat meal, solely for the
purpose of making the wheat go as far as
possible, and thus saving as much as they
could from the home consumption, for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>better supply of the army on the continent.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Eighty thousand men were quartered
in barracks in the counties of Essex and
Suffolk. A great many were also quartered
throughout the towns, at taverns,
in squads of thirty or forty in a place.
Throughout the whole of Great Britain,
the soldiers were supplied with this coarse
bread. It was deposited in the store-rooms
with the other provisions of the
army; and on the day that it was baked,
and at nine o’clock the next morning, was
distributed to the soldiers—who were at
first exceedingly displeased with the bread,
and refused to eat it, often casting it from
them with great rage, and violent execrations.
But after two or three weeks they
began to be much pleased with it, and
preferred it to the fine flour bread.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My father,” continues Mr. P., “whom
I have often heard talk these things over,
was a miller and a baker, and resided in
the county of Essex, on the border joining
Suffolk, and near the barracks containing
the eighty thousand soldiers. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>contracted with government, to supply
the eastern district of the county of Essex,
with the kind of bread I have mentioned:
and he used always to send me with it to
the depositories on the day it was baked:
and though I was then a youth, I can still
very distinctly remember the angry looks
and remarks of the soldiers, when they
were first supplied with it. Indeed they
often threw their loaves at me as I passed
along, and accompanied them with a volley
of curses. The result of this experiment
was, that not only the wheat was
made to go much farther, but the health
of the soldiers improved so much and so
manifestly, in the course of a few months,
that it became a matter of common remark
among themselves, and of observation
and surprise among the officers and
physicians of the army. These gentlemen
at length came out with confidence and
zeal on the subject, and publicly declared
that the soldiers were never before so
healthy and robust; and that disease of
every kind had almost entirely disappeared
from the army. The public papers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>were for months filled with recommendations
of this bread, and the civic physicians
almost universally throughout Great
Britain, pronounced it far the most healthy
bread that could be eaten, and as such,
recommended it to all the people, who
very extensively followed the advice:—and
the coarse wheaten bread was very
generally introduced into families—female
boarding schools, and indeed all public
institutions. The nobility also generally
used it; and in fact, in many towns, it
was a rare thing to meet with a piece of
fine flour bread. The physicians generally
asserted that this wheaten bread
was the very best thing that could be taken
into the human stomach, to promote digestion
and peristaltic action; and that it,
more than anything else, would assist the
stomach in digesting other things which
were less easily digested, and therefore
they recommend that a portion of it should
be eaten at every meal with other food.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Still, after this extensive experiment
had been made with such happy results,
and after so general and full a testimony
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>had been given in favor of the coarse
wheaten bread, when large supplies of
superfine flour came in from America, and
the crops at home were abundant, and
the act of parliament in relation to the
army became extinct, most of the people
who had before been accustomed to the
use of fine flour bread, now by degrees
returned again to their old habits of eating
fine bread. Many of the nobility, however,
continued to use the coarse bread
for a number of years afterwards. General
Hanoward, Squire Western, Squire Hanbury
and others living near my father’s,
continued to use the bread for a long time,
and some of them still used it when I left
home and came to America, in 1816.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The testimony of sea captains and old
whalemen is equally in favor of wheaten
bread. “I have always found,” said a
very intelligent sea captain of more than
thirty years’ experience, “that the coarser
my ship bread, the healthier my crew is.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A writer in Rees’ Cyclopædia, (article
Bread) says—“The inhabitants of Westphalia,
who are a hardy and robust people,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>and capable of enduring the greatest fatigues,
are a living testimony to the salutary
effects of this sort of bread; and it is
remarkable that they are very seldom
attacked by acute fevers, and those other
diseases which are from bad humors.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In short, as I have already stated, the
bread of a large portion of the laboring
class, or peasantry, throughout Europe,
Asia and Africa, and the islands of the
ocean, whether leavened or unleavened—whether
more or less artificially prepared,
is made of the whole substance of the
grain from which it is manufactured: and
no one who is sufficiently enlightened in
physiological science to qualify him to
judge correctly in this matter, can doubt
that bread made in the best manner from
unbolted wheat meal, is far better adapted
to the anatomical structure and physiological
powers of the alimentary organs
of man, than bread made of superfine
wheat flour; and consequently, the former
is far more conducive to the health and
vigor and general well-being of man than
the latter.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>If, therefore, mankind will have raised
bread which in every respect most perfectly
conforms to the laws of constitution
and relation established in their nature,
and is most highly conducive to the welfare
of their bodies and souls, then must
it be well made, well baked, light and
sweet bread, which contains all the natural
properties of the wheat. And if they will
have this bread of the very best, and most
wholesome kind, they must, as I have
already stated, see that the soil from
which their wheat is raised, is of a proper
character, and is properly tilled,—that the
wheat is plump—full-grown—ripe, and
free from rust and other diseases; and
then, before it is ground, they must see that
it is thoroughly cleansed, not only from
chaff, cockles, tares, and such like substances,
but also from all smut, and every
kind of impurity that may be attached to
the skin of the kernel. And let every one
be assured that this is a matter which
really deserves all the attention and care
that I suggest.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>If human existence is worth possessing,
it is worth preserving; and they who have
enjoyed it as some have done, and as all
the human family are naturally endowed
with the capabilities to enjoy it, certainly
will not doubt whether it is worth possessing;
nor, if they will properly consider
the matter, can they doubt that its preservation
is worthy of their most serious and
diligent care.</p>

<p class='c008'>And when they perceive how intimately
and closely the character of their bread is
connected with the dearest interests of
man, they will not be inclined to feel that
any reasonable amount of care and labor
is too much to be given to secure precisely
the right kind of bread.</p>

<p class='c008'>I repeat, then, that they who would have
the very best bread should certainly wash
their wheat, and cleanse it thoroughly
from all impurities, before they take it to
the mill; and when it is properly dried, it
should be ground by sharp stones which
will cut rather than mash it: and particular
care should be taken that it is not
ground too fine. Coarsely ground wheat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>meal, even when the bran is retained,
makes decidedly sweeter and more wholesome
bread than very finely ground meal.
When the meal is ground, it should immediately
be spread out to cool before it is
put into sacks or casks:—for if it is packed
or enclosed in a heated state, it will be far
more likely to become sour and musty.
And I say again, where families are in
circumstances to do wholly as they choose
in the matter, it is best to have but little
ground at a time; as the freshly ground
meal is always the liveliest and sweetest,
and makes the most delicious bread.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the meal is thus prepared and
brought home, whether in a barrel or sack,
the next thing to be attended to, is, that it
be placed and kept in a perfectly clean,
and sweet, and well ventilated meal room.
It should on no consideration be put into a
closet, or pantry, or store-room, which is
seldom aired, and more rarely cleansed;
and into which all manner of rubbish is
thrown; or even where other kinds of
provisions are kept. If the meal be put
into a pantry or store-room which is confined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>and dirty, and into which old boots
and shoes, and old clothes and pieces of
carpet, and other things of this kind, are
thrown—or where portions of vegetable or
animal substance, whether cooked or uncooked,
are habitually or even occasionally
put and permitted to remain, it must be
expected, as a matter of course, of necessity,
that the quality of the meal will be
considerably deteriorated by the impurities
with which the air of the place will be
loaded, and which will be continually
generated there.</p>

<p class='c008'>People generally have but a sorry idea
of what constitutes true cleanliness; but
they may be assured that they cannot be
too deeply impressed with the importance
of keeping their meal room as clean and

  <h2 class='c004'>FERMENTATION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Chemical composition of flour. Yeast—modes of preparing
it. Substitutes for it. Fermentation, and its products.
Vinous, acetous and putrefactive fermentation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having procured good wheat, cleansed
it thoroughly, and got it properly ground,
and placed in the meal room, the next step
is to take a portion of the meal and manufacture
it into good bread. But in order that
this may be done in the most certain and
perfect manner, it is important that the
properties of the meal and the principles
concerned in bread-making should be well
understood.</p>

<p class='c008'>According to the statement of Prof.
Thomson, of Edinburgh, one pound of
good wheat meal contains ten ounces of
farina or starch, three ounces of bran,
six drams of gluten and two drams of
sugar;—and it is because wheat contains
such proportions of these substances that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>it makes the very best loaf bread. The
farina or starch is the principal nourishing
property;—the saccharine matter or sugar
is also highly nutrient; but in the process
of making loaf bread, it serves mainly, by
its vinous fermentation, to produce the gas
or air by which the dough is raised and the
bread made light. The gluten is likewise
a very nutrient property, but in loaf bread,
it principally serves, by its cohesiveness,
like gum elastic, or India rubber, to prevent
the gas or air formed by the fermentation
of the sugar, from escaping or
passing off;—and the gas being thus retained,
inflates or puffs up the dough, and
makes it porous and light. The bran,
with its mucilaginous and other properties,
not only adds to the nutritiousness of the
bread, but eminently serves to increase its
digestibility, and to invigorate the digestive
organs, and preserve the general integrity
of their functions.</p>

<p class='c008'>The wheat which is raised in Virginia
and the southern states generally, contains
a larger proportion of gluten than that
which is raised in the western part of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>the state of New York. Hence bakers are
able to make a larger loaf of bread out of
a pound of southern flour than they can
out of a pound of western flour; and consequently
some of them have endeavored
to make their customers believe that the
southern flour is the most profitable. It
certainly <i>is</i> the most profitable for the
baker; but it is not the most profitable for
the consumer.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next thing indispensably necessary
to the making of good bread, is good lively
sweet yeast, or leaven, to produce what is
called the panary, or more properly, the
vinous fermentation of the saccharine matter,
or sugar.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some bread-makers will do best with
one kind of yeast or leaven, and some with
another. I have generally found that
people do best with those materials to
which they have been most accustomed;
but I am sorry to find so general a dependence
on breweries for yeast. To say
nothing of the impure and poisonous substances
which brewers employ in the manufacture
of beer, and which always affect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>the quality of their yeast, I am confident
that domestic yeast can be made of a far
superior quality. However light and good
in other respects that bread may be which
is made with brewers yeast, I have rarely
if ever seen any in which I could not at
once detect the disagreeable properties of
the yeast.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are various ways of making
domestic yeast. One of the simplest, and
perhaps the best, is the following, which
was communicated to me by one of the
best bread-makers I ever saw:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Put into one gallon of water a double
handful of hops;—boil them fifteen or
twenty minutes, then strain off the water
while it is scalding hot;—stir in wheat
flour or meal till it becomes a thick batter,
so that it will hardly pour;—let it stand
till it becomes about blood warm, then add
a pint of good lively yeast, and stir it well;
and then let it stand in a place where it
will be kept at a temperature of about 70° F.
till it becomes perfectly light, whether
more or less time is required; and then it
is fit for use;—or if it is desired to keep a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>portion of it, let it stand several hours and
become cool; and then put it into a clean
jug and cork it tight, and place it in the
cellar where it will keep cool; and it may
be preserved good, ten or twelve days, and
even longer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Another way by which yeast when thus
made may be preserved much longer, and
perhaps more conveniently, is, to take it
when it has become perfectly light, and
stir in good Indian meal until it becomes a
hard dough: then take this dough and
make it into small thin cakes, and dry
them perfectly, without baking or cooking
them at all. These cakes, if kept perfectly
dry, will be good for several weeks and
even months.</p>

<p class='c008'>When yeast is needed, take some of
these cakes (more or less according to the
quantity of bread desired) and break them
fine and dissolve them in warm water, and
then stir in some wheat flour till a batter
is formed, which should be kept at a temperature
of about 60° F. till the yeast
becomes light and lively, and fitted for
making bread.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>Others, in making this yeast, originally
put into the water with the hops, a double
handful of good clean wheat bran, and
boil them up together and strain off the
water as above described: others again,
boil up a quantity of wheat bran without
the hops, and make their yeast in all other
respects as above described.</p>

<p class='c008'>The milk yeast is greatly preferred by
many; and when it is well managed, it
certainly makes very handsome bread.
The way of making it is simple. Take a
quart of milk fresh from the cow, (more or
less according to the quantity of bread
desired,)—a little salt is generally added,
and some add about half a pint of water
blood warm, but this is not essential;—then
stir wheat flour or meal into the
milk till it forms a moderately thick batter;
and then cover it over, and place
it where it will remain at a temperature
of from 60° to 70° F. till it becomes
perfectly light. It should then be used
immediately: and let it be remembered
that dough made with this yeast will sour
sooner than that made with other yeast;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>and also that the bread after it is baked
will become extremely dry and <i>crumbly</i>
much sooner than bread made with other
yeast. Yet this bread, when a day old,
is exceedingly light and beautiful: albeit
some dislike the animal smell and taste
which it derives from the milk.</p>

<p class='c008'>In all these preparations of yeast and
dough, it should ever be recollected that
“the process of fermentation cannot go on
when the temperature is below 30° F.,
that it proceeds quite slowly at 50°, moderately
at 60°, rapidly at 70°, and very
rapidly at 80°.”</p>

<p class='c008'>If, therefore, it is desired to have the
yeast or dough stand several hours before
it is used or baked, it should be kept at a
temperature of about 50°. But in the
ordinary way of making bread, a temperature
varying from 60° to 70°, or about
summer heat, is perhaps as near right as
it can well be made.</p>

<p class='c008'>Prof. Thomson gives the following directions
for making yeast in large quantities:—“Add
ten pounds of flour to two
gallons of boiling water;—stir it well into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>a paste, let this mixture stand for seven
hours, and then add about a quart of good
yeast. In about six or eight hours, this
mixture, if kept in a warm place, will
have fermented and produced as much
yeast as will make 120 quartern loaves”
(of 4 lbs. each.)</p>

<p class='c008'>A much smaller quantity can be made
by observing due proportions of the ingredients.</p>

<p class='c008'>To raise bread in a very short time
without yeast, Prof. Thomson gives the
following recipe:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dissolve in water 2 ounces, 5 drams
and 45 grains of common crystallized carbonate
of soda, and mix the solution well
with your dough, and then add 7 ounces, 2
drams and 22 grains of muriatic acid of the
specific gravity of 1,121, and knead it as
rapidly as possible with your dough;—it
will rise immediately—fully as much, if
not more than dough mixed with yeast—and
when baked, will be a very light
and excellent bread.” Smaller quantities
would be required for small batches of
bread.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>A tea-spoonful or more (according to
the quantity of dough or batter) of super-carbonate
of soda dissolved in water, and
flour stirred in till it becomes a batter, and
then an equal quantity of tartaric acid
dissolved and stirred in thoroughly, will in
a few minutes make very light batter for
griddle or pancakes; or if it be mixed into
a thick dough, it will make light bread.</p>

<p class='c008'>Good lively yeast, however, makes better
bread than these alkalies and acids: howbeit
these are very convenient in emergencies,
when bread or cakes must be prepared
in a very short time; or when the
yeast has proved inefficient.</p>

<p class='c008'>We see then that wheat meal consists of
certain proportions of starch, gluten, sugar,
bran, &amp;c.; and that in making loaf bread,
we add yeast or leaven, in order to produce
that kind of fermentation peculiar to
saccharine matter or sugar, which is called
vinous, and by which the gas or air is
formed that raises the dough. But the
sugar is an incorporate part of every particle
of the meal, and is therefore equally
diffused throughout the whole mass; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>hence if we would make the very best loaf
bread, the fermentive principle or yeast
must also be equally diffused throughout
the whole mass, so that a suitable portion
of yeast will be brought to act at the same
time on every particle of saccharine matter
in the mass.</p>

<p class='c008'>But let us endeavor to understand this
process of fermentation. To speak in the
language of chemistry, sugar is composed
of certain proportions of carbon, oxygen
and hydrogen. The yeast, acting on the
sugar, overcomes those affinities by which
these substances are held in the constitutional
arrangement of sugar, and the process
of decay or decomposition of the
sugar takes place, which is called vinous
fermentation. By this process of decay,
two other forms of matter are produced, of
an essentially different nature from each
other and from the sugar. One of them
is called carbonic acid gas or air, being
formed by a chemical combination of
certain proportions of carbon and oxygen.
The other is known by the name of alcohol,
and consists of a chemical combination of
certain proportions of carbon, oxygen, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>hydrogen. Carbonic acid gas is also produced
by animal respiration or breathing,
by the combustion of wood, coal, &amp;c. &amp;c.
and in other ways of nature and of art:
but neither in nature nor in art is there
any known way by which alcohol can be
produced, except by that process of the
decay or destruction of sugar called vinous
fermentation.</p>

<p class='c008'>The carbonic acid gas, produced in the
manner I have stated, is the air which inflates
or puffs up and swells out the bread,
when there is sufficient gluten or other
cohesive matter in the dough to prevent
its escape.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the dough be permitted to stand too
long in a warm place, the fermentation,
having destroyed most or all of the sugar,
will begin to act on the starch and mucilage,
and destroy their nature, and produce
vinegar; and therefore this stage of it is
called the acetous fermentation: and if it
still be permitted to go on, it will next
commence its work of destruction on the
gluten; and this is called the putrefactive
fermentation, because it in many respects resembles
the putrefaction of animal matter.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>The vinous fermentation, therefore, by
which the dough is raised and made light,
may be carried to all necessary extent, and
still be limited in its action to the saccharine
matter or sugar—leaving the starch
and gluten, and other properties of the
meal, uninjured; and this is the point at
which the fermentation should be arrested
by the heat that bakes the dough. If it be
permitted to go beyond the sugar, and act
on the mucilage and starch, and produce
acidity, the excellence of the bread is in
some degree irreparably destroyed. The
acid may be neutralized by pearlash or
soda, so that the bread shall not be sour;
but still, something of the natural flavor
of the bread is gone, and it is not possible
by any earthly means to restore it; and
this injury will always be in proportion to
the extent to which the process of the
acetous fermentation is permitted to go in
destroying the nature of the starch, and the
bread will be proportionably destitute of
that natural sweetness and delicious richness
essential to good bread. Yet it is
almost universally true, both in public and
domestic bread-making, that the acetous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>fermentation is allowed to take place; and
saleratus, or soda, or some other chemical
agent is employed to neutralize the acid.
By this means we may have bread free
from acidity, it is true, but it is also destitute
of the best and most delicious properties
of good bread; and generally, by the
time it is twenty-four hours old—and this
is particularly true of bakers’ bread—it is
as dry and tasteless and unsavory as if it
were made of plaster of Paris.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many bread-makers mix their saleratus
or soda with their yeast, or introduce it
when they mix their dough, so that if the
acetous fermentation does take place, the
acid is neutralized by the alkali, and therefore,
not being perceived, it is supposed
never to have existed, and the bread is
called sweet and good; especially if a
small quantity of molasses be employed in
making the dough. Others far more wisely
withhold their alkali till the dough is
raised enough to mould into the loaf, and
then if it is found to be in any degree acid,
a solution of saleratus or soda is worked
into it, so as just to neutralize the acid, and
no more. This is infinitely better that no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>have sour bread, which, after all, is almost
everywhere met with; yet the very best
bread that can be made in this way is only
second best. Happy are they who can
make good light and sweet bread, without
the use of molasses—without suffering the
least degree of acetous fermentation to take
place, and without employing saleratus,
soda, or any other kind of alkali.</p>

<p class='c008'>The third or putrefactive stage of fermentation
rarely takes place in domestic
bread-making; but it is by no means uncommon
in public bakeries. Indeed it is
thought necessary in the manufacture of
certain kinds of crackers, in order to make
them split open, and render them brittle,
and cause them readily to become soft
when dipped into water. But dyspepsia
crackers, and all other kinds of bread made
in this way are, to say the least of them,
miserable stuff. For besides the fact that
all the best qualities of the flour or meal
have been destroyed by fermentation, the
great quantity of alkali employed in neutralizing
the acid, is necessarily injurious
to the digestive organs.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>PREPARATION OF BREAD.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Mixing. Much kneading necessary. Rising, or fermentation.
Use of alkalies, saleratus and soda. Baking. Ovens.
Alcohol in bread. Preservation of bread.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, then, the business of the bread-maker
is, to take the wheat meal, prepared
in the manner I have stated, and
with all the properties I have described,
and convert it into good, light, sweet, well-baked
bread, with the least possible change
in those properties; so that the bread, when
done, will present to the senses of smell
and taste, all the delicious flavor and delicate
sweetness which pure organs perceive
in the meal of good new wheat,
just taken from the ear and ground, or
chewed without grinding; and it should
be so baked that it will, as a general statement,
require and secure a full exercise of
the teeth in mastication.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>In order to do this, as we have seen, it
is necessary, in the first place, that the
wheat should be of the best kind, and well
cleansed, and the meal properly prepared.
In the next place, it is necessary that the
yeast should be fresh, lively and sweet;
and in the third place, it is necessary that
the dough should be properly mixed,
raised and baked.</p>

<p class='c008'>Take then such a quantity of meal, in a
perfectly clean and sweet bread trough, as
is necessary for the quantity of bread
desired, and having made a hollow in the
centre, turn in as much yeast as a judgment
matured by sound experience shall deem
requisite; then add such a quantity of
water, milk and water, or clear milk, as
is necessary to form the meal into a dough
of proper consistency. Some prefer bread
mixed with water alone; others prefer
that which is mixed with milk and water;
and others think that bread mixed with
good milk is much richer and better; while
others dislike the animal odor and taste
of bread mixed with milk. Perhaps the
very best and most wholesome bread is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>that which is mixed with pure soft water,
when such bread is made perfect. But
whether water, milk and water, or milk
alone is employed, it should be used at
a temperature of about blood heat.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here let it be understood, that the starch
of the meal is of such a nature that, by a
delicate process peculiar to itself, it becomes
changed into sugar or saccharine
matter; and when the fluid used in mixing
the dough is of a proper temperature,
and the dough is properly mixed and
kneaded, this process, to some small extent,
takes place, and a small portion of the
starch is actually converted into sugar,
and thereby increases the sweetness of the
bread. Let it also be recollected here,
that the saccharine matter on which the
yeast is to act, is equally diffused throughout
the whole mass of the meal; and
therefore if the yeast be not properly diffused
throughout the whole mass, but is
unequally distributed, so that an undue
quantity of it remains in one part, while
other parts receive little or none, then the
fermentation will go on very rapidly in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>some parts of the mass, and soon run into
the acetous state, while in other parts it
will proceed very slowly or not at all; and
consequently large cavities will be formed
in some parts of the dough, while other
parts of it will remain as compact and
heavy as when first mixed, and sometimes
even more so. I need not say that such
dough cannot be made into good bread;
yet it is probably true, that more than nine
tenths of the bread consumed in this
country is more or less of this character.
Nor, after what I have said, should it
seem necessary for me to remark, that good
bread cannot be made by merely stirring
the meal, and yeast, and water or milk
together into a thin dough or sponge, and
suffering it to ferment with little or no
working or kneading. Bread made in this
manner, if it is not full of cavities large
enough for a mouse to burrow in, surrounded
by parts as solid as lead, is almost
invariably full of cells of the size of large
peas and grapes; and the substance of the
bread has a shining, glutinous appearance;
and if the bread is not sour, it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>because pearlash or some other kind of
alkali has been used to destroy the acid.</p>

<p class='c008'>The very appearance of such bread is
forbidding, and shows, at a glance, that it
has not been properly mixed—that the
yeast has acted unequally on different
portions of the meal, and that the fermentation
has not been of the right kind.</p>

<p class='c008'>But if the yeast be so diffused throughout
the whole mass, as that a suitable
portion of it will act on each and every
particle of the saccharine matter at the
same time, and if the dough be of such
a consistency and temperature as not to
admit of too rapid a fermentation, then
each minute portion of saccharine matter
throughout the whole mass will, in the
process of fermentation, produce its little
volume of air, which will form its little
cell, about the size of a pin’s head, and
smaller; and this will take place so nearly
at the same time, in every part of the
dough, that the whole will be raised and
made as light as a sponge, before the
acetous fermentation takes place in any
part. And then if it be properly moulded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>and baked, it will make the most beautiful
and delicious bread—perfectly light
and sweet, without the use of any alkali,
and with all the gluten and nearly all the
starch of the meal remaining unchanged
by fermentation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Proper materials, proper care, a due
amount of labor, a suitable length of time,
and proper temperature, are all, therefore,
necessary to the making of good bread.</p>

<p class='c008'>With your meal, and yeast, and water
or milk brought together before you, then,
proceed in the light of the instruction you
have now received, to mix your dough;
and remember that the more thoroughly
you knead it, the more equally you diffuse
the yeast throughout the whole mass, and
bring it to act on every particle of the
saccharine matter at the same time, and
the whiter, lighter, and more delicious you
make your bread.</p>

<p class='c008'>Who that can look back thirty or forty
years to those blessed days of New England’s
prosperity and happiness, when our
good mothers used to make the family
bread, but can well remember how long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>and how patiently those excellent matrons
stood over their bread troughs, kneading
and moulding their dough? and who with
such recollections cannot also well remember
the delicious bread that these mothers
used invariably to set before them? There
was a natural sweetness and richness in it
which made it always desirable; and
which we cannot now vividly recollect,
without feeling a strong desire to partake
again of such bread as our mothers made
for us in the days of our childhood.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let it be borne in mind, then, that without
a very thorough kneading of the dough,
there can be no just ground of confidence
that the bread will be good. “It should
be kneaded,” says one of much experience
in this matter, “till it becomes flaky.”
Indeed I am confident that our loaf bread
would be greatly improved in all its qualities,
if the dough were for a considerable
time subjected to the operations of the
machine which the bakers call the break,
used in making crackers and sea-bread.</p>

<p class='c008'>The wheat meal, and especially if it is
ground coarsely, swells considerably in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>the dough, and therefore the dough should
not, at first, be made quite so stiff, as that
made of superfine flour; and when it is
raised, if it is found too soft to mould well,
let a little more meal be added.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the dough has been properly
mixed and thoroughly kneaded, cover it
over with a clean napkin or towel, and a
light woollen blanket kept for the purpose,
and place the bread trough where the
temperature will be kept at about 60° F.,
or about summer heat, and there let it
remain till the dough becomes light. But
as it is impossible to regulate the quantity
and quality of your yeast, the moisture
and temperature of your dough, and several
other conditions and circumstances, so as
to secure at all times precisely the same
results in the same time, it is therefore
necessary that careful attention should be
given that the proper moment should be
seized to work over and mould the dough
into the loaf, and get it into the oven, just
at the time when it is as light as it can be
made by the vinous fermentation, and before
the acetous fermentation commences.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>If, however, by any means there should
unfortunately be a little acidity in the
dough, take a small quantity of saleratus,
or, what is better, carbonate of soda, and
dissolve it in some warm water, and carefully
work in just enough to neutralize
the acid. The best bread-makers are so
exceedingly careful on this point, that
they dip their fingers into the solution of
saleratus or soda, and thrust them into the
dough in every part, as they work it over,
so as to be sure that they get in just
enough to neutralize the acid, and not a
particle more.</p>

<p class='c008'>I must here repeat, that they who would
have the very best of bread, must always
consider it a cause of regret, that there
should be any necessity to use alkali;
because the acetous fermentation cannot in
any degree take place, without commensurately
and irremediably impairing the
quality of the bread. And here it should
be remarked, that dough made of wheat
meal will take on the acetous fermentation,
or become sour, sooner than that made of
fine flour. This is probably owing principally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>to the mucilage contained in the bran,
which runs into the acetous fermentation
sooner than starch.</p>

<p class='c008'>While the dough is rising, preparations
should be made for baking it. Some bake
their bread in a brick oven, some in a
stove, some in a reflector, and some in a
baking kettle. In all these ways very
good bread may be baked; but the baking
kettle is decidedly the most objectionable.
Probably there is no better and more certain
way of baking bread well than in the use
of the brick oven. Good bread-makers,
accustomed to brick ovens, can always
manage them with a very great degree of
certainty; and as a general fact, bread is
sweeter, baked in this way, than in any
other. Yet, when it is well baked in tin
reflectors, it is certainly very fine; and so
it is also when well baked in iron stoves.
But the baking of bread requires almost
as much care and judgment as any part
of the process of bread-making. If the
oven is too hot, the bread will burn on the
outside before it is done in the centre; if
it is too cold, the bread will be heavy, raw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>and sour. If the heat is much greater
from below than from above, the bottom of
the loaf will burn before the top is done:
or if the heat is much greater from above
than from below, the top of the loaf will
burn before the bottom is done.</p>

<p class='c008'>All these points therefore must be carefully
attended to; and no small excuse
ought to be considered a satisfactory apology
for sour, heavy, raw or burnt bread;
for it is hardly possible to conceive of an
absolute necessity for such results; and
the cases are extremely rare in which they
are not the offspring of downright and
culpable carelessness.</p>

<p class='c008'>The best bread-makers I have ever
known, watch over their bread troughs
while their dough is rising, and over their
ovens while it is baking, with about as
much care and attention as a mother
watches over the cradle of her sick child.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dough made of wheat meal requires a
hotter oven than that made of fine flour;
and it needs to remain in the oven longer.
Indeed, it is a general fault of bread of
every description, made in this country,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>that it is not sufficiently baked. Multitudes
eat their bread hot and smoking
from the oven in a half-cooked state; and
very few seem to think there is any impropriety
in doing so. But they who
would have their bread good, not only a
few hours after it comes from the oven,
but as long as it can be kept, must see
that it is thoroughly baked.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have said that the process of vinous
fermentation converts a portion of the saccharine
matter of the meal into carbonic
acid gas or air, by which means the dough
is raised and made light; and that the
same process converts a portion of the
saccharine matter into alcohol. The alcohol
thus generated is mostly if not entirely
driven off by the heat of the oven when
the dough is baking;—and in modern
times, ovens have been so constructed in
England, as to serve the double purpose
of ovens and stills; so that while the
bread is baking, the alcohol is distilled off
and condensed, and saved for the various
uses of arts and manufacture.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>The question has, however, been frequently
started, whether a portion of the
alcohol thus generated, is not contained in
the bread when it comes from the oven.</p>

<p class='c008'>This question cannot be answered with
entire certainty; but there are some facts
in relation to it of considerable importance.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is perfectly certain that if two portions
of wheat meal or flour be taken from the
same barrel or sack, and one portion be
made into unleavened bread, and the other
portion be made into the very best fermented
or raised bread, and both be eaten
as soon as they are baked, the fermented
bread will digest with more difficulty, and
oppress and disturb the stomach more
than the unleavened bread will. Indeed
it is well known and very generally understood,
that few of the articles which
compose the food of man in civic life, are
so trying to the human stomach, and so
powerful causes of dyspepsia, as fresh-baked
raised bread.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is now well known also that alcohol
wholly resists the action of the solvent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>fluid of the stomach, and is entirely indigestible;
and always retards the digestion
of those substances which contain it. How
far all this may be true of carbonic acid
gas, is not yet ascertained; but it is difficult
to account for the difference between
leavened and unleavened bread, as above
stated, without supposing that the alcohol
or carbonic acid gas, or both of them, are
in some degree concerned in rendering the
leavened bread, when newly baked, peculiarly
oppressive and injurious to the
stomach.</p>

<p class='c008'>This, be it remembered, is purely a conjecture
of my own; and I am not entirely
certain that it is correct; but I see no
other way of meeting the difficulty.</p>

<p class='c008'>Be it as it may, however, it is very
certain that when the bread has been
drawn from the oven, and permitted to
stand in a proper place twenty-four
hours, either by evaporation or some other
means, it becomes perfectly matured, and
so changed in character, that it is, if
properly made, one of the most wholesome
articles entering into the diet of man; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>at that age, there is not the slightest reason
to believe that a particle of alcohol remains
in the bread.</p>

<p class='c008'>When therefore the bread is thoroughly
baked, let it be taken from the oven and
placed on a perfectly clean and sweet shelf,
in a perfectly clean and well ventilated
pantry. Do not, as you value the character
of your bread, put it into a pantry
where you set away dishes of cold meat,
cold potatoes, and other vegetables, and
keep your butter, cheese and various other
table provisions—in a pantry which perhaps
is seldom thoroughly cleansed with
hot water and soap, and where the pure
air of heaven seldom if ever has a free
circulation. The quality of your bread
should be of too much importance to
allow of such reprehensible carelessness,
not to say sluttishness. And if you will
have your bread such as every one ought
to desire to have it, you must pay the
strictest attention to the cleanliness and
sweetness of the place where you keep it.</p>

<p class='c008'>If in baking, the outer crust should become
a little too dry and crispy, you can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>easily remedy this by throwing a clean
bread or table cloth over it for a short time
when it first comes from the oven; but if
this is not necessary, let the bread stand on
an airy shelf, till it becomes perfectly cool,
and when it is twenty-four hours old, it is
fit for use; and if it is in all respects
properly made, and properly kept, it will
continue to be sweet and delicious bread
for two or even three weeks, except perhaps
in very hot and sultry weather.</p>

<p class='c008'>When we have acquired the art of
making such bread as I have described,
in the very best manner, then have we carried
the art of cooking to the very height
of perfection; for it is not only true, that
there is no other artificially prepared article
in human diet of so much importance as
bread, but it is also true that there is no
other preparation in the whole round of
cooking, which requires so much care, and
attention, and experience, and skill, and
wisdom.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>WHO SHOULD MAKE BREAD.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Making bread by rule. Bakers. Domestics. Sour bread.
An anecdote. Mrs. Van Winkle. Bad bread need not
be made. How cake is made. Bread-making a drudgery.
Excellent example of a mother. Eating bad bread.
Importance of having good bread.</p>

<p class='c007'>Who then shall make our bread? For
after all that science in its utmost accuracy
can do, in ascertaining principles and in
laying down rules, there is little certainty
that any one, who undertakes to make
bread merely by rule, will be anything
like uniformly successful. We may make
a batch of bread according to certain rules,
and it may prove excellent; and then we
may make another batch according to the
same rules, which may be very poor. For
if we follow our rules ever so closely, there
may be some slight differences in the quality
or condition of the meal or the yeast,
or something else, which will materially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>alter the character of the bread, if we do not
exercise a proper care and judgment, and
vary our operations according as the particular
circumstances of the case may require.</p>

<p class='c008'>Correct rules are certainly very valuable;
but they can only serve as general
way-marks, in the art of bread-making.
Uniform success can only be secured by
the exercise of that mature judgment
which is always able to dictate those extemporaneous
measures which every exigency
and circumstance may require; and
such a judgment can only result from a
care and attention and experience which
are the offspring of that moral sensibility
which duly appreciates the importance of
the quality of bread, in relation to the
happiness and welfare of those that consume
it.</p>

<p class='c008'>But are we to look for such a sensibility
in public bakers? Can we expect that
they will feel so lively and so strong an
interest for our enjoyment and for our
physical and intellectual and moral well-being,
that they will exercise all that care
and attention and patience, and watch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>with that untiring vigilance and solicitude
in all the progress of their operations,
which are indispensably necessary in order
to secure us the best of bread?</p>

<p class='c008'>Or can we reasonably expect to find
these qualifications in domestics—in those
who serve us for hire? Many a female
domestic, it is true, can make much better
bread than her mistress can. Many a
female domestic has an honest and sincere
desire to do her duty faithfully; but can
she be actuated by those sensibilities and
affections which alone can secure that
careful attention, that soundness of judgment,
that accuracy of operation, without
which the best of bread cannot uniformly,
if ever, be produced?</p>

<p class='c008'>No;—it is the wife, the mother only—she
who loves her husband and her
children as woman ought to love, and who
rightly perceives the relations between
the dietetic habits and physical and moral
condition of her loved ones, and justly
appreciates the importance of good bread
to their physical and moral welfare—she
alone it is, who will be ever inspired by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>that cordial and unremitting affection and
solicitude which will excite the vigilance,
secure the attention, and prompt the action
requisite to success, and essential to the
attainment of that maturity of judgment
and skilfulness of operation, which are
the indispensable attributes of a perfect
bread-maker. And could wives and
mothers fully comprehend the importance
of good bread in relation to all the bodily
and intellectual and moral interests of
their husbands and children, and in relation
to the domestic and social and civil
welfare of mankind, and to their religious
prosperity, both for time and eternity,
they would estimate the art and duty of
bread-making far, very far more highly
than they now do. They would then
realize that, as no one can feel so deep and
delicate an interest for their husbands’
and children’s happiness as they do, so no
one can be so proper a person to prepare
for them that portion of their aliment,
which requires a degree of care and attention
that can only spring from the lively
affections and solicitude of a wife and
mother.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>But it is a common thing to hear women
say—“We cannot always have good
bread, if we take ever so much pains;—it
will sometimes be heavy, and sometimes
be sour, and sometimes badly baked, in
spite of all our care.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It may be true that such things will
sometimes happen, even with the best of
care;—but I believe that there is almost
infinitely more poor bread than there is
any good excuse for. The truth is, the
quality of bread is a matter of too little
consideration; and therefore too little care
is given to the making of it. Moreover,
the sense of taste is so easily vitiated, that
we can very easily become reconciled to
the most offensive gustatory qualities, and
even learn to love them; and it is a very
common thing to find families so accustomed
to sour bread, that they have no
perception of its acid quality.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is very strange,” said a lady to me
one day at her dinner table, “that some folks
always have sour bread, and never know
it.” She then went on to name a number of
families in the circle of her acquaintance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>who, she said, invariably had sour bread
upon their tables when she visited them—“and
they never,” continued she, “seem
to have the least consciousness that their
bread is not perfectly sweet and good.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Yet this very lady, at the very moment
she was thus addressing me, had sour
bread upon her own table; and although
I had for many months been very frequently
at her table, I had never found
any but sour bread upon it. Still she was
wholly unconscious of the fact.</p>

<p class='c008'>Difficult however as most women think
it is, to have good bread always, yet there
are some women who invariably have excellent
bread. I have known such women.
The wife of Thomans Van Winkle, Esq.
of the beautiful valley of Booneton, New
Jersey—peace to her ashes!—was deservedly
celebrated throughout the whole
circle of her acquaintance for her excellent
bread. Few ever ate at her hospitable
board once that did not desire to enjoy
the privilege again. I know not how
often it has been my good fortune to sit at
her table; but the times have not been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>few; and though long past, and she who
presided there has slept for years in her
grave, yet the remembrance of those times
and of those hospitalities, awakens in my
bosom a deep and fervent sentiment of
gratitude while I write.</p>

<p class='c008'>Never at the table of Mrs. Van Winkle
did I eat poor bread;—and of my numerous
acquaintances who had sat at her
table, I never heard one say he had eaten
poor bread there. Her bread was invariably
good. Nay, it was of such a quality
that it was impossible for any one to eat
of it, and not be conscious that he was
partaking of bread of extraordinary excellence.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Van Winkle, said I to her one day,
while I was feasting on her delicious
bread, tell me truly, is there either a
miracle or mystery in this matter of bread-making,
by which you are enabled to
have such excellent bread upon your table
at all times, while I rarely ever find bread
equally good at any other table, and at
ninety-nine tables in a hundred, I almost
invariably find poor bread? Is it necessarily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>so? Is it not possible for people
by any means to have good bread uniformly?</p>

<p class='c008'>“There is no necessity for having poor
bread at any time, if those who make it
will give proper care and attention to their
business,” replied Mrs. Van Winkle, confidently.
“The truth is,” continued she,
“most people attach very little importance
to the quality of their bread; and therefore
they give little care to the preparation of it.
If every woman would see that her flour is
sweet and good, that her yeast is fresh
and lively, that her bread trough is kept
perfectly clean and sweet, that her dough
is properly mixed and thoroughly kneaded,
and kept at a proper temperature, and
at the proper time moulded into the loaf,
and put into the oven, which has been
properly heated, and there properly baked,
then good bread would be as common as
poor bread now is. But while there is
such perfect carelessness and negligence
about the matter, it is not surprising that
bread should be generally poor.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>Mrs. Van Winkle was undoubtedly correct.
If anything like the care were given
to bread-making that its real importance
demands, a loaf of poor bread would rarely
be met with. Indeed, if the same degree
of care were given to bread-making, that
is devoted to the making of cakes and
pastry, we should far more generally be
blessed with good bread.</p>

<p class='c008'>Who does not know, that as soon as girls
are old enough to go into company and to
give parties, they begin to notice with
great interest the qualities of the different
kinds of cake and pastry which they meet
with; and whenever they find anything
very nice, they are exceedingly curious to
learn precisely how it was made. And
lest memory should be treacherous, they
will carefully write down the exact rules
for mixing and cooking it;—“so many
pounds of flour, so many pounds of butter,
so many pounds of sugar, so many eggs,
and spice to your taste—the eggs to be
beaten so and so, the whole mixed so and
so, and baked so many minutes,” &amp;c. &amp;c.
And thus with great care and industry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>they collect and write down, in a book
which they keep for the purpose, all the
recipes they can get hold of, for making
every kind of cake and pastry used in society.
And when they are preparing for
company, they rarely if ever order Dinah
or any other domestic to make their nice
cake. They do not regard it as a menial
office, but as a highly genteel employment;
and their great desire to have their cake
and pastry as good as it can be made,
prompts them to undertake the manufacture
of it themselves. And during this
operation, the scales, the measures, the
clock or watch, all are brought into requisition;
the Recipe Book is placed upon the
table before them, and carefully consulted;
and everything is done with the utmost
precision, and exactitude, and vigilance.
And if the young lady feels any misgiving
as to her own judgment, or taste, or experience,
she earnestly inquires of Ma, or
some one else who she thinks is capable
of giving her advice in so important a
matter.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>If in the midst of this employment some
one knocks or rings at the door, and a
young gentleman is announced, she is not
at all embarrassed, but perhaps hastens to
the parlor with her delicate hands covered
with dough, and with an air of complacency
and self-satisfaction, says—“Good
morning, Frank—how do you do? I am
just engaged in making some cake—I hope
you will excuse me for a few moments.”</p>

<p class='c008'>All this shows that she regards the quality
of her cake as of very great importance,
and considers it not only perfectly respectable
but highly <i>genteel</i>, for a young lady
to be employed in making cake. But in
regard to bread and bread-making, everything
is very different; there is none of
this early curiosity to learn how to make
good bread. Young ladies do not on every
occasion when they find excellent bread,
carefully and minutely inquire how it was
made, baked, &amp;c., and write down the
recipe;—but when a batch of bread is to
be made for the family, they either leave
it for Mother or some domestic to make, or
go about it themselves as some irksome
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>and disreputable piece of drudgery; and
consequently they turn the task off their
hands with as much despatch and as little
trouble as possible. If all things happen
to be as they should be, it is well; if not,
they must answer for the present. If the
yeast happens to be lively and sweet, very
lucky. If otherwise, still it must be used.
If the dough rises well and is got into the
oven before it becomes sour, very fortunate;
if not, why, “nobody can avoid
mistakes—and bread will sometimes be
poor in spite of the greatest care;”—and if
a batch of miserable bread is the result of
such an operation, then all that remains to
be done is to eat it up as soon as possible,
and hope for better the next time.</p>

<p class='c008'>If Frank or Charles or Edward should
call while the young lady is engaged in
making bread, she is perhaps quite disconcerted,
and would not for the world have
him know what she is doing;—she sends
word to him, either that she is out, or that
she is particularly engaged, and begs he
will excuse her;—or if by any means she
happens unexpectedly to be caught at her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>employment, she is greatly embarrassed,
and makes the best apology she can for
being engaged in such menial services.</p>

<p class='c008'>As a matter of course, while such are
the views and feelings entertained on this
subject, and while such is the manner in
which this duty is performed, it will ever
be a mere accident if good bread is made;
and a mere accident if such girls ever
become good bread-makers when they are
wives and mothers.</p>

<p class='c008'>But if parents, and especially mothers,
could view this matter in its true light, how
differently would they educate their children.
They would then feel that, grateful
as it is to a mother’s heart to see her
daughters highly refined and elegantly
accomplished, and able to “make the instrument
discourse most eloquent music,”
and to transfer living nature, with all its
truth and beauty and sublimity, to the
canvass, still the art of bread-making,
when considered in all its relations and
intimate connections with human health,
and prosperity, and virtue, and happiness,
and with reference to the natural responsibilities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>and duties of woman, is actually
one of the highest and noblest accomplishments
that can adorn the female character.
And then, too, would they consider it of
exceedingly great importance, that their
daughters should possess this accomplishment,
even though they may never be in
circumstances which will require the exercise
of it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some eight or nine years since, I spent
several months in the delightful village of
Belvidere, on the banks of the Delaware, in
Pennsylvania. While there, I enjoyed for
a number of weeks the kind hospitality of
S― S―, Esq., a lawyer, and a gentleman
of great moral excellence. Mrs. S. was
born and brought up, I believe, in Philadelphia.
Her father was a man of wealth,
and she was the only daughter, and—almost
as a matter of course—was indulged
in all that she desired. But there
were so many of the elements of a good
wife and mother in her natural composition,
that as soon as she entered into those
interesting and important relations, she
began to devote herself to the duties of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>them with a sincerity and conscientiousness
which could not fail of success. Surrounded
as she was, with wealth, and every comfort
and convenience of life, and all of its
luxuries that she desired, still she was
industrious in her habits, and vigilantly
attentive to all the concerns of her household.
She usually kept three female domestics,
who, by her kind maternal deportment
towards them, were warmly attached
to her. She had no difficulty in procuring
nor in keeping help, because she always
treated them in such a manner that they
loved to stay with her; and she took much
pains to qualify them for the proper discharge
of their duties. They evidently
loved her, and were sincerely desirous of
performing all their services in such a
manner as would be pleasing to her. Yet
with all these advantages to justify her
leaving such a duty to her domestics, Mrs.
S. invariably made the family bread with
her own hands. Regularly as the baking
day came, she went into her kitchen and
took her stand beside the bread trough, and
mixed and kneaded the dough, and put
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>it in its proper place for rising, and, in due
time, moulded it into the loaf and baked it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Do you always make your bread, madam?
I inquired one day, as she returned
from the performance of that task. “Invariably,”
she replied: “that is a duty I
trust no other person to do for me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But cannot your domestics make good
bread? I asked. “I have excellent domestics,”
answered Mrs. S., “and they
can, perhaps, make as good bread as I
can; for they have been with me several
years, and I have taken pains to learn
them how to do my work; and they are
exceedingly faithful and affectionate, and
are always willing to do all they can to
please me; but they cannot feel for my
husband and my children as I do, and
therefore they cannot feel that interest
which I do, in always having such bread
as my husband and my children will love
and enjoy. Besides, if it were certain
their care and vigilance and success in
bread-making would be always equal to
mine, yet it is wholly uncertain how long
they will remain with me. Various circumstances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>may take place, which may
cause them to leave me, and bring me
into dependence upon those who know not
how to make good bread; and therefore I
choose to keep my own hand in. But,
apart from all other considerations, there
is a pleasure resulting from the performance
of this duty, which richly rewards
me for all the labor of it. When my
bread is made and brought upon the table,
and I see my husband and children eat it
and enjoy it, and hear them speak of its
excellence, it affords me much satisfaction,
and I am glad to know that I have contributed
so much to their health and happiness;
for, while my bread is so good
that they prefer it to anything else upon
the table, there is little danger of their
indulging, to any injurious extent, in those
articles of food which are less favorable
to their health.”</p>

<p class='c008'>I need not say that this lady invariably
had excellent bread upon her table. But
instances of this kind are, I regret to say,
extremely rare, even in christian communities;
and therefore when such cases are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>known, they ought to be held up as most
noble examples of female virtue, and receive
such high commendations as their
intrinsic merit deserves, and such as will
be calculated to beget in the minds of
others an exalted sense of the dignity and
importance of such duties, and prompt
every wife and mother to the intelligent
and affectionate performance of them.</p>

<p class='c008'>For it should ever be remembered that,
though our children, while they depend on
us for protection, are also properly the
subjects of our government, yet as soon as
they are capable of appreciating our authority
and our influence, they are, like
ourselves, moral agents, and ought, in all
respects, to be governed and nurtured as
such; and therefore it is not enough that
we can give them such bread as we
think best for them, and <i>compel</i> them
to eat it; but the grand point at which the
mother should always aim, in this matter,
is, to place before her children such bread
as is the very best for them, and at the
same time, to make it the most agreeable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>to them, and thereby make their duty and
their enjoyment perfectly coincide.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let no one therefore say she cannot
always have good bread, until she can
truly affirm that she has fairly made the
experiment; that she has, in view of all
its relations and bearings, accurately estimated
the importance of the quality of her
bread in regard to the welfare of her
household, and, with a proper sense of her
responsibilities as a wife and mother, has
<i>at all times</i> felt that interest and exercised
that care and attention which so important
a duty demands, and without which it
must ever be a mere accident whether her
bread is good or bad.</p>

<p class='c008'>They that will have good bread, not
only for a single time, but uniformly, must
make the quality of their bread of sufficient
importance, in their estimation and
feelings, to secure the requisite attention
to the means by which alone such an end
can be made certain. They must not suffer
themselves, through carelessness, to get
entirely out of bread unexpectedly, and
thus be obliged, without due preparation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>to make up a batch of such materials as
they may happen to have at hand, and
bake it in haste, and hurry it to the table.
But they must exercise providence and
foresight: they must know, beforehand,
when their supply of bread will probably
be out, and when they will need to make
another batch; and they must see beforehand
that measures are taken to secure a
proper supply of all the requisite materials—see
that they are furnished with good
meal or flour; and they must be sure to
have the best of yeast or leaven, when
they need it—and when the time comes
for them to make their bread, if by any
means the yeast should not be good, let
them throw it away and make good, before
they proceed to make their bread; for it is
infinitely better that the family should
even do without bread one day, and eat
roasted potatoes, than that they should eat
poor bread three or four days; and if, from
any cause, the bread should be poor, it is
incomparably better to throw it away,
than to set it upon the table, to disgust
the whole family with bread, and drive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>them to make most of their meal on something
else.</p>

<p class='c008'>If a lady can ever find a good excuse
for having poor bread, she certainly can
find none, except perhaps extreme poverty,
for setting her poor bread on the table the
second time. Yet, too generally, women
seem to think that, as a matter of course,
if they, by carelessness or any other means,
have been so unlucky as to make a batch
of poor bread, their family and friends
must share their misfortune, and help them
eat it up; and, by this means, many a
child has had its health seriously impaired,
and its constitution injured, and
perhaps its moral character ruined—by
being driven, in early life, into pernicious
dietetic habits.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was observed many years ago, by
one of the most eminent and extensive
practitioners in New England, that, during
a practice of medicine for thirty years, he
had always remarked that, in those families
where the children were most afflicted
with worms, he invariably found poor
bread; and that, as a general fact, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>converse of this was true; that is, in those
families where they uniformly had heavy,
sour, ill-baked bread, he generally found
that the children were afflicted with
worms.</p>

<p class='c008'>A careful and extensive observation for
a few years, would convince every intelligent
mind that there is a far more intimate
relation between the quality of the bread
and the moral character of a family, than
is generally supposed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Keep that man at least ten paces from
you, who eats no bread with his dinner,”
said Lavater, in his “Aphorisms on Man.”
This notion appears to be purely whimsical
at first glance; but Lavater was a
shrewd observer, and seldom erred in the
moral inferences which he drew from the
voluntary habits of mankind; and depend
upon it, a serious contemplation of this
apparent whim, discloses a deeper philosophy
than is at first perceived upon the
surface.</p>

<p class='c008'>Whatever may be the cause which turns
our children and ourselves away from the
dish of bread, and establishes an habitual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>disregard for it, the effect, though not perhaps
in every individual instance, yet, as
a general fact, is certainly, in some degree,
unfavorable to the physical, and intellectual,
and moral, and religious, and social,
and civil and political interests of man.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of all the artificially prepared articles
of food which come upon our table, therefore,
bread should be that one which, as a
general fact, is uniformly preferred by our
children and our household,—that one, the
absence of which they would notice soonest,
and feel the most,—that one which—however
they may enjoy for a time the
little varieties set before them—they would
be most unwilling to dispense with—and
which, if they were driven to the necessity,
they would prefer to any other dish,
as a single article of subsistence.</p>

<p class='c008'>To effect this state of things, it is obvious
that the quality of the bread must be
uniformly excellent; and to secure this, I
say again, there must be a judgment, an
experience, a skill, a care, a vigilance,
which can only spring from the sincere
affections of a devoted wife and mother,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>who accurately perceives and duly appreciates
the importance of these things, and,
in the lively exercise of a pure and delicate
moral sense, feels deeply her responsibilities,
and is prompted to the performance
of her duties.</p>

<p class='c008'>Would to God that this were all true of
every wife and mother in our country—in
the world!—that the true relations, and
interests, and responsibilities of life were
understood and felt by every human being,
and all the duties of life properly and
faithfully performed!</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>VARIETIES OF BREAD.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Rye bread. Indian meal bread. Use of sour milk, or butter-milk.
Acids. Family grinding.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have thus far spoken almost entirely
of wheaten bread, because I consider that
the most wholesome kind of bread for ordinary
use—for “daily bread.” When bread
is made of superfine flour, the same general
rules should be observed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rice, barley, oats, rye, Indian corn, and
many other farinaceous products of the
vegetable kingdom, may also be manufactured
into bread, but none of them will
make so good bread as wheat. Good rye,
raised on a sandy soil, when cleansed and
ground in the manner I have already described,
and prepared in all respects according
to the rules I have laid down, will
make very excellent bread. Rye, coarsely
ground, without bolting, and mixed with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>Indian meal, makes very wholesome bread,
when it is well made. Good rye and Indian
bread is far more wholesome for common
or every-day use, than that made of
superfine flour.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are various ways of preparing
Indian meal bread; and when such bread
is well made, it is very wholesome—much
more so, for every-day use, than superfine
flour bread. “In a memoir lately read
before the French Academy,” says the
Journal of Health, “the author undertook
to show that maize (Indian corn) is more
conducive to health than any other grain;
and, as a proof of this, the fact was adduced
that, in one of the departments in
which this grain was most abundantly and
universally used, the inhabitants were remarkable
for their health and vigor.”</p>

<p class='c008'>One great drawback to the wholesomeness
of Indian meal bread, however, is, that
it is almost universally eaten hot, and too
generally, pretty well oiled with butter, or
some other kind of animal fat or oil. But
Indian meal bread can be prepared in such
a manner as to obviate these difficulties,
and render it very wholesome.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>Barley and oats may be manufactured
into very wholesome bread; but they are
little used for such purposes in this country.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rice, peas, beans, potatoes, &amp;c., may
also, by mixing them with a portion of
wheat or rye flour, be manufactured into
bread; but, as I have already stated, there
is no other kind of grain or farinaceous
vegetable substance from which so good
loaf bread can be made, as good wheat.</p>

<p class='c008'>In making bread from Indian meal, and
other kinds of farinaceous substances containing
little or no gluten, yeast or leaven
is rarely if ever used to make it light.
More generally sour milk or butter-milk
and saleratus or soda are used for this
purpose; and they who do not well understand
the principle upon which these
substances make their bread light, often
greatly impair their own success by their
mismanagement.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is, perhaps, most common for them to
mix their sour milk or butter-milk and saleratus
together, and wait till the effervescence
is over, before they stir in their meal.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>But by this means they lose the greater
part of the gas or air by which their dough
should be made light.</p>

<p class='c008'>The true way is, to take their sour milk
or butter-milk, and stir meal into it till a
thin batter is formed, and then dissolve
their saleratus or soda, and stir that quickly
and thoroughly into the batter, and then
hastily add meal till the batter or dough is
brought into the consistency desired.</p>

<p class='c008'>If, instead of sour milk or butter-milk, a
solution of muriatic or tartaric acid is used,
the bread will be equally light. In this
case, the batter should be first made with
a solution of saleratus or soda, and then
the solution of acid should be stirred in
as above described. Batter cakes are
made in this manner very light and very
promptly. When from any cause batter
or dough mixed with yeast fails to rise
according to expectations, the thorough
mixing in, first the solution of muriatic
or tartaric acid, and then the solution of
saleratus or soda, will, in a few minutes,
make the whole mass very light; but such
cakes and bread are not so sweet and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>savory as those raised with good sweet
yeast.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have said that recently ground meal
makes far sweeter and richer bread, than
that which has been ground a considerable
time; but as it is not convenient for
many families to send to a mill as often as
they would like to have fresh meal, they
are obliged generally to use staler meal or
flour than they would choose. Yet every
family might easily be furnished with
a modern patent hand-mill, constructed
after the plan of a coffee mill, with which
they could at all times, with great ease,
grind their wheat, and rice, and corn, as
they want it, for bread and other purposes.
With these mills they can grind their stuff
as finely or coarsely as they wish, for
bread or hominy, and always have it very
fresh and sweet.</p>

<p class='c015'>The “Young Mother” is designed as an every-day manual
for those who are desirous of conducting the physical education
of the young—from the very first—on such principles as
Physiology and Chemistry indicate. It inculcates the great
importance of preventing evil—especially physical evil—by
implanting good habits. We believe it to be the only work
of a popular character, written by a medical man, on this
subject, and that it is, on this account, doubly valuable. It is
recommended by the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal,
and by the Press generally, as a work which should be possessed
by every family. The following remarks by the
editor of the Portland Christian Mirror, will give some idea
of the manner in which it has been noticed in various parts
of the country, though many of the best periodicals have
spoken of it in still stronger terms of approbation:</p>

<p class='c015'>“The subject of this book is of vital interest to the whole
human family, and is treated by Dr. Alcott with the most
intelligible simplicity. We hope it will find its way into the
hands of all who are entrusted with the training and rearing
of children; and that its sound views will supplant many of
those hurtful maxims and practices which are lamentably
prevalent, and that the existing generation of mankind will
be succeeded by a more healthy and a more moral race.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The great difficulty of making a subject which has hitherto
been deemed dry and unintelligible, at once agreeable and
interesting to the young mind, has led the author of this
volume to describe the human body as a <span class='sc'>House</span>.</p>

<p class='c015'>The work treats, first, on the <span class='sc'>Frame</span>—consisting of the
bones, muscles, tendons, &amp;c.; secondly, of the <span class='sc'>Covering</span>—consisting
of the skin, hair, nails, eyes, ears, &amp;c.; and
thirdly, of the <span class='sc'>Apartments</span> and <span class='sc'>Furniture</span>—by which
are meant the interior cavities and organs. Nearly every
anatomical and physiological term which appears in the work
is so used or so explained, as to be at once clearly understood
and apprehended. The subject is illustrated by numerous
engravings.</p>

<p class='c015'>The best recommendation of this work is, that it has been
universally approved of by the families and schools where it
has been introduced, and by all medical men who have
examined it. It has also received the entire approbation of
the Press, and is selling rapidly.</p>

<p class='c015'>This work was prepared to meet the demand of the present
exigency. Thousands of families, in the poorer and middling
classes of society, are suffering from their unwise attempts to
live in the style of those persons whose means are far
greater than their own. The author has endeavored to convince
them—in a brief manner—that a very few things only,
are really indispensable to physical and even intellectual
comfort and happiness—and that both these are within the
reach of all, even in times like the present, would they be
content to live in a manner at once rational, simple and
healthful. It discusses the following subjects:</p>

<p class='c015'>Estates and Business; Houses and Furniture; Equipage
and Servants; Dress; Food and Drink; Medicine and Physicians;
Books and Schools; Customs and Habits; Society;
and gives several interesting Examples of living on small

<p class='c015'>With the emendations and improvements made in this

<p class='c015'>This work is based on the principle, that the great business
of the wife is Education—the education of herself and her
family. It therefore exhibits the duties of a wife, especially
to her husband, in a manner at once original and striking.
The author presupposes her to have set out in matrimony
with christian principles and purposes; and hence proceeds
to inculcate what he deems the best methods of applying
them in the routine of daily life and conversation. We
believe that no one can rise from the perusal of this volume
without a higher respect for female character, as well as a
higher confidence in the divine wisdom of matrimony.</p>

published in numbers of 32 pages each, in neat book style for
binding into a volume, illustrated by engravings, and is now
on the third year of its publication. The numbers of the two

<p class='c015'>This work discusses, in a familiar manner, all subjects
connected with physical education and self-management. It
treats on the connection of <span class='fss'>LIGHT</span>, <span class='fss'>AIR</span>, <span class='fss'>TEMPERATURE</span>,

and <span class='fss'>LONGEVITY</span>. The editor takes the ground
that a proper understanding of the constitutional laws of the
human body, and of all its organs and functions, and a strict
obedience thereto, are indispensable to the highest perfection
and happiness—present and future—of every living human
being. He deems this knowledge more and more indispensable
in proportion to the progress of civilization and refinement.
The work is pledged to support no system nor set of
principles, any farther than that system and those principles
can be proved to be based on the laws of Physiology, and
revealed truth, and on human experience; and consequently
its pages are always open to fair and temperate discussion.</p>

<p class='c015'>The work has recently been warmly approved of by
<span class='sc'>George Combe</span>, (author of the “Constitution of Man,”) as
well as a large number of distinguished men of this country,

<p class='c015'>“The Library of Health, is, in my opinion, an excellent
publication. It seems to be well adapted to aid in the great
reform in habits and customs which is now going on in this
country and Great Britain; and which, it may be hoped, will
extend to other parts of the world. I beg leave to recommend
this little work to all who are desirous of promoting
their health of body and tranquillity of mind.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The following remarks, from the Annals of Education for
1834, are from the pen of <span class='sc'>William C. Woodbridge</span>;
whose long and zealous devotion to the cause of education,
and whose extensive travels and researches both in Europe
and America, and special attention to the subject of which he
here speaks, pre-eminently qualify him to judge accurately
in the matter:</p>

<p class='c015'>“We are rejoiced to see a work published in our country,
on a topic in physiology which the ‘artificial modesty’ to
which we have formerly alluded, has covered up, until a
solitary, but fatal vice is spreading desolation through our
<i>schools</i> and <i>families</i>, unnoticed or unknown. The experience
of teachers, the case-books of physicians, and the painful
exposures which accident, or the dreadful diseases which
follow in its train, have occasionally produced, have at
length forced it upon public attention; and we hope it will
not again be forgotten. The work before us is the result of
extensive observation and study; its usefulness has been
tested by its influence as a lecture; and its views of this evil
are in accordance with the experience of the few teachers
whom we have known possessed of the moral courage to
encounter it. We would offer it to those who have earnestly
desired a work on this subject, as one adapted to their purposes.
We would recommend its perusal to every <i>parent</i>
and <i>teacher</i>. We would warn them that those who have been
most confident of the safety of their charge, have often been
most deceived; and that the youthful bashfulness which
seems to shrink from the bare mention of the subject, is
<i>sometimes</i> the blush of shame for concealed crime. We feel
bound to add, what abundant and decisive evidence has
shown, that ignorance on this subject is no protection from
the vice—nay, that it is often the original cause or encouragement
of it; that it gives tenfold power to the evil example
and influence which are so rarely escaped; and that a cure
can be effected only by the most careful instruction and long
continued discipline, both physical and moral, directed by
sad experience, as is presented in this work.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The following brief but highly valuable testimony is from
the distinguished superintendent of the Massachusetts Lunatic
Hospital at Worcester:</p>

<p class='c019'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>:—The subject of your Lecture to Young
Men, has been much neglected, although of great importance.</p>

<p class='c015'>This lecture, while it sounds the alarm to the young, will
not fail to awaken the attention of parents, if once perused.
It is couched in language as delicate as the nature of the
subject will admit, and may be read with propriety and
benefit by all.</p>

<p class='c015'>The evil of which it treats, if I mistake not, is more extensively
sapping the foundation of <i>physical vigor</i> and <i>moral
purity</i>, in the rising generation, than is generally apprehended,
even by those who are awake to the danger, and who have
witnessed the deplorable influence of it upon its victims.</p>

<p class='c020'>Yours, with respect,</p>
<p class='c021'>S. B. WOODWARD.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The following is from Dr. <span class='sc'>Alcott</span>; author of the works
advertised on the preceding pages—addressed to Dr. <span class='sc'>Graham</span>.</p>

<p class='c019'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>:—The subject of your Lecture to Young
Men is one of immense importance, and demands the profound
attention of every friend of man. It is vain longer to
shuffle it off, when those whose opportunities best qualify them
to give an opinion, do not hesitate to say that solitary vice is
rapidly gaining ground among us. It is a subject which
must be met.</p>

<p class='c015'>In this view, I rejoice to find that an increasing demand
for your little work has justified the publication of a second
edition. I rejoice, especially, to see such sound principles in
physiology inculcated and warmly enforced. I have no hesitation
in saying that it ought to be circulated throughout our
country. It would thus not only save many a young person
from the murderous fangs of quackery, but—what is much
better—it would prevent the necessity of his applying either
to quacks or physicians for relief from a situation in which he
ought never to be placed.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The following is an extract from a letter written by the
chaplain of one of our New England State Prisons to a
brother clergyman in a neighboring state:</p>

<p class='c015'>“I have read the book <i>three</i> times, and derived more
benefit from the last, than from either of the other readings.
I like this book. Why is it not in the hands of every young
man, especially in cities, to counteract the influence of indecent
pictures and corrupting books?</p>

<p class='c015'>One excellence in Graham’s Lecture, as it strikes me, is,
that it is so purely philosophical. Even an atheist might see
force in his statements. A man must deny many of the best
established principles of science, before he can deny most of
the conclusions to which the lecturer comes.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The Boston Recorder, and several other valuable periodicals,
coincide with these testimonials.</p>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
